1,"Solids, liquids and gases","The kinetic theory is an attempt to explain why materials occur in three different forms, or states. The particles in solids, liquids and gases are arranged differently and move in different ways.The table below summarises the arrangement and movement of the particles in solids, liquids and gases and shows simple diagrams for the arrangement of the particles.The theory can be used to explain the different properties of solids, liquids and gases.State Property Explanation Solids Have a shape and do not flow The particles only vibrate around a fixed point and do not move from place to place. Cannot be squashed The  particles are touchingLiquidsFlow and adopt the shape of the container. The particles can roll over each other because the bonds between them are not strong enough to keep them in a fixed positionCannot be squashedThe particles are touchingGasesSpread out to fill their container. The particles are moving quickly in all directionsCan be squashed. There are large spaces between the particlesAdding heat energy to particles either raises the temperature and they move faster, or bonds are broken to change from solid to liquid (melting) or liquid to gas (boiling). If a gas is allowed to cool, particles slow down and bonds reform to make a liquid (condensing) and if the liquid cools enough it turns to a solid (freezing). Limitations of the particle theory - HigherParticles are hard round spheres like marbles that do not make and break new bonds when they touch. We have to imagine these bonds forming and breaking even though we would not see this when using marbles to show the difference between solids, liquids and gases.",States of matter,States of matter,States of matter,States of matter
2,Density,"Jonny Nelson explains density with a GCSE Physics practical experiment. Density describes how closely packed the particles are in a solid, liquid or gas.curriculum-key-factDensity is the amount of mass per unit volume.Solids, liquids and gasesAll matter contains particles. The difference between the different states of matter is how the particles are arranged:in a solid _ particles are tightly packed in a regular structurein a liquid _ particles are tightly packed but free to move past each otherin a gas _ particles are spread out and move randomlyChanging the state of a material will change its density There is only a small difference between the density of a liquid and its corresponding solid, eg water and ice. This is because the particles are tightly packed in both states. The same number of particles in a gas spread further apart than in the liquid or solid states. The same mass takes up a bigger volume. This means the gas is less dense. Density also depends on the material. A piece of iron with the same dimensions as a piece of aluminium will be heavier because the atoms are more closely packed and each iron atom has much more mass than each aluminium atom.Scientists can measure density by measuring the mass of a certain volume of the material, for example, one cubic centimetre.MaterialDensity in grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm3)Iron7.8Ice0.98Water1Air0.00129Calculating densityDensity can be calculated using the equation:\[\text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}\]\[\rho = \frac{m}{V}\]This is when:density (_) is measured in kilograms per metre cubed (kg/m3)mass (m) is measured in kilograms (kg)volume (V) is measured in metres cubed (m3)ExampleWhat is the density of a material if 0.45 cubic metres (m3) of it has a mass of 0.2 kg? \[\rho = \frac{m}{V}\]\[\rho = \frac{0.2}{0.45}\]\(\rho\) = 0.44 kg/m3QuestionWhat is the density of a material if 4 cubic metres (m3) of it has a mass of 2,200 kg? Reveal answerupdown\[\rho = \frac{m}{V}\]\[\rho = \frac{2,200}{4}\]\(\rho \) = 550 kg/m3The units for densityAlthough the standard unit for mass is kilograms (kg) and for volume it is cubic metres (m3), in many laboratory situations the norm is to find mass in grams (g) and volume in cubic centimetres (cm3). Calculating density using grams and centimetres cubed will give a density unit of grams per centimetre cubed (g/cm3).QuestionWhat is the density of a material if 15 cm3 of it has a mass of 30 g?Reveal answerupdown\[\rho = \frac{m}{V}\]\[\rho = \frac{30}{15}\]\(\rho\) = 2 g/cm3curriculum-key-fact1 g/cm3 is equal to 1,000 kg/m3To convert from kg/m3 to g/cm3, divide by 1,000.To convert from g/cm3 to kg/m3, multiply by 1,000.Aluminium has a density of 2.7 g/cm3, or 2,700 kg/m3. Lead has density 11.6 g/cm3, or 11,600 kg/m3.ExampleIron has a density of 7.9 g/cm3 - what is this in kg/m3?7.9 multiplied by 1,000 gives 7,900 kg/m3.QuestionWhat is the density of an object in kg/m3 if it is 653.1 g/cm3?Reveal answerupdown653.1 multiplied by 1,000 would give 653,100 kg/m3.

3,Required practical - determining density,"There are different ways to investigate density. In this required practical activity, it is important to:record the mass accurately measure and observe the mass and the bigger volume of the different objectsuse appropriate apparatus and methods to measure  volume and mass and use that to investigate densityAim of the experimentTo measure the density of various materials.MethodMethod 1: Regular solidsUse a ruler to measure the length (l), width (w) and height (h) of a steel cube.Place the steel cube on the top pan balance and measure its mass.Calculate the volume of the cube using (l x w x h).Use the measurements to calculate the density of the metal.Use vernier callipers to measure the diameter of the sphere. Place the metal sphere on the top pan balance and measure its mass.Calculate the volume of the sphere using \(\frac{4}{3}\pi(\frac{\text{d}}{2})^{3}\).Use the measurements to calculate the density of the metal.Method 2: Stone or other irregular shaped objectPlace the stone on the top pan balance and measure its mass.Fill the displacement can until the water is level with the bottom of the pipe.Place a measuring cylinder under the pipe ready to collect the displaced water.Carefully drop the stone into the can and wait until no more water runs into the cylinder.Measure the volume of the displaced water.Use the measurements to calculate the density of the stone.Method 3: Water or any liquidPlace the measuring cylinder on the top pan balance and measure its mass.Pour 50 cm3 of water into the measuring cylinder and measure its new mass.Subtract the mass in step 1 from the mass in step 2. This is the mass of 50 cm3 of water.Use the measurements to calculate the density of the water.ResultsSome example results could be:ObjectMass / gVolume / cm³Density g/cm³Density kg/m³Steel cube46860............Steel sphere334.19............Stone35668............Water5050............AnalysisUsing the results from the table above, the densities can be calculated using:Density = mass ÷ volumeMass of steel cube = 468 gVolume of steel cube = 60 cm3Density = mass ÷ volume 468 ÷ 60 = 7.8 g/cm3 (= 7,800 kg/m3)Diameter of steel sphere = 2 cmMass of steel sphere = 33 gVolume of steel sphere = \(\frac{4}{3}\pi(\frac{\text{d}}{2})^{3}\) = 4.19 cm3Density = mass ÷ volume33 ÷ 4.19 = 7.9 g/cm3 (= 7,900 kg/m3) For a stone of mass 356 g, the volume of water displaced into the measuring cylinder is 68 cm3.  Density = mass ÷ volume356 ÷ 68 = 5.2 g/cm3 (= 5,200 kg/m3).Mass of 50 cm3 of water is found to be 50 g.Density = mass ÷ volume50 ÷ 50 = 1 g/cm3 (= 1,000 kg/m3). EvaluationDensity can be measured for regular solids, irregular solids and liquids.Densities calculated from measurements are subject to experimental error. This could be because:
             	 the top pan balances, when used by different people, may not be identically calibratedthe resolution of the measuring cylinders may be different, causing different values for the volume to be recordedthe displacement can may not have been set up correctly each time and any additional drops of water would cause some to dribble out of the spout before useThe experiment above shows steel to have two different values for density. One reason may be that some measurements are taken to different numbers of significant figures and this can create rounding errors. It can also mean that the actual value may be between 7.8 g/cm3 and 7.9 g/cm3.Hazards and control measuresHazardConsequenceControl measuresWater spilled from displacement canSlip and fallUse a measuring cylinder to collect displaced water and prevent spills",States of matter,States of matter,States of matter,States of matter
4,Gas pressure,"The particles in a solid simply vibrate around a fixed point, the particles in a liquid roll over each other. The particles in a gas are moving very quickly in random directions. The speeds of the particles in the gas vary but, on average, they move quicker than they do in liquids and solids. This means that it does not take long for a gas to spread out to fill its entire container. The smell of an air freshener can spread all around a room very quickly.Since the particles in a gas are moving fast and randomly, collisions occur frequently. These collisions may be between two particles, between a particle and the wall of the container, or between a particle and something else in the container.The force acting on the container due to these collisions is at right angles to the container.For example, the collisions caused by a gas trapped inside a balloon cause forces to act outwards in all directions, giving the balloon its shape.A person standing in a room full of air is constantly being hit by the particles of the gases that make up the air. This is the origin of atmospheric pressure. curriculum-key-factThe pressure in the atmosphere at sea level is about 100,000 N/m2. When a gas is heated, the particles have more kinetic energy and move faster. If the volume does not change the particles hit harder and more often causing the pressure to rise. Pressure cookers are an example of where this happens. ",States of matter,States of matter,States of matter,States of matter
5,Heating and changes of state,"When a material is heated or cooled, two changes may happen to the particles within the material:Chemical bonds between the particles may form, break or stretch. There is a change in the chemical potential store of energy in the material.The material will heat up or cool down as the particles within it gain or lose speed. There is a change in the thermal store of energy within the material.curriculum-key-factThe internal energy is the total amount of energy in the thermal and chemical potential stores of all the particles in the system. When energy is given to raise the temperature, particles speed up and gain energy. The conservation of energy means that, assuming no energy is lost to the environment, any energy transferred to a material will be distributed between the chemical store and the thermal store of the internal energy. When the substance melts or boils, energy is put in to breaking the bonds that are holding particles together, which increases the energy in the system. Throughout all of these changes the total number of particles, or mass, does not change.The bonds between particles in one substance may have a different strength to the bonds between particles in another substance. If these bonds are stronger, more internal energy will be needed to break them and so the temperature for melting or boiling will be higher.curriculum-key-factA change of state is a physical change because it can be reversed. Heating ice will turn it into water; freezing water turns it back to ice. ",States of matter,States of matter,States of matter,Energy changes
6,Pure substances and mixtures,"Many different particles may be found in a perfect cup of coffee. All the ingredients; coffee, milk, water and sugar, add their own particles into the mixture.Milk is a mixture of many different particles; fat, protein, water, sugar and minerals.curriculum-key-factA mixture contains different types of particles that are not joined together chemically.Pure bottled water should contain only H2O molecules (the particles that make up the water). In reality, it is unlikely that any sample of water stays pure for very long as things will very quickly dissolve in the water. For example, gas particles in the air or particles from the walls of the water pipes are often found in 'pure' water.curriculum-key-factA pure substance only contains one type of particle.It is often easy to distinguish whether a material is pure by finding the temperature at which it changes state. The presence of an impurity usually changes the melting and boiling point. Pure water will boil at 100°C and freeze at 0°C. If the water has something dissolved in it, eg salt, it will boil at a temperature higher than 100°C and freeze at a temperature lower than 0°C. Putting salt on a wet road means that the temperature has to get colder before the water freezes into ice.Scientists can measure the melting or boiling point of a substance to determine if it is a pure substance or not.",States of matter,States of matter,States of matter,Interactions over small and large distances
7,"Energy, temperature and specific heat capacity","If energy is absorbed by a block of lead, the particles gain energy. Since lead is a solid and the particles are vibrating, they vibrate faster after being heated.Different substances require different amounts of energy to gain temperature. It takes less energy to raise the temperature of a 1 kg block of lead by 1°C, than it does to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1°C.From this it can be seen that a change in temperature of a system depends on:the mass of the material the substance of the material specific heat capacitythe amount of energy put into the systemcurriculum-key-factThe specific heat capacity of a material is the energy required to raise one kilogram (kg) of the material by one degree Celsius (°C). The specific heat capacity of water is 4,200 joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg°C). This means that it takes 4,200 J to raise the temperature of 1 kg of water by 1°C.Some other examples of specific heat capacities are:MaterialSpecific heat capacity (J/kg/°C)Brick840Copper385Lead129Lead has a low specific heat capacity and will warm up and cool down faster because it doesn't take much energy to change its temperature.Brick will take much longer to heat up and cool down because its specific heat capacity is higher than that of lead so more energy is needed for the same mass to change the same temperature. This is why bricks are sometimes used in storage heaters, as they stay warm for a long time. Most heaters are filled with oil (1,800 J/kg/°C). Radiators in central heating systems use water (4,200 J/kg/°C) as they need to stay warm for a long time, so must have a lot of energy to lose. Calculating thermal energy changesThe amount of thermal energy stored or released as the temperature of a system changes can be calculated using the equation:change in thermal energy = mass _ specific heat capacity _ temperature changeOr:\[\Delta \text{E} = \text{m} \times \text{c} \times \Delta \theta\]This is when:change in thermal energy (_E) is measured in joules (J)mass (m) is measured in kilograms (kg)specific heat capacity (c) is measured in joules per kilogram per degree Celsius (J/kg°C)temperature change (__) is measured in degrees Celsius (°C)ExampleHow much energy is needed to raise the temperature of 3 kg of copper by 10°C?

8,Changes of state and specific latent heat,"Jonny Nelson introduces an animated explanation of latent heatChanging the internal energy of a material will cause it to change temperature or change state:the energy required for a particular change in temperature is given by the specific heat capacity and the mass of materialthe energy required for a particular change in state is given by the specific latent heat and the mass of materialcurriculum-key-factSpecific latent heat is the amount of energy required to change the state of 1 kilogram (kg) of a material without changing its temperature.As there are two boundaries, solid/liquid and liquid/gas, each material has two specific latent heats:latent heat of fusion _ the amount of energy needed to freeze or melt 1 kg of the material at its melting pointlatent heat of vaporisation _ the amount of energy needed to evaporate or condense 1 kg of the material at its boiling pointSome typical values for specific latent heat include:SubstanceSpecific latent heat of fusion (kJ/kg)Specific latent heat of vaporisation (kJ/kg)Water3342,260Lead22.4855Oxygen13.9213An input of 334,000 joules (J) of energy is needed to change 1 kg of ice into 1 kg of water. The same amount of energy needs to be taken out of the liquid to freeze it.Calculating thermal energy changesThe amount of thermal energy stored or released as the temperature of a system changes can be calculated using the equation:energy required for a change of state = mass _ specific latent heat\[\Delta \text{E} = \text{m} \times \text{l}\]This is when:energy (\(\Delta \text{E}\)) is measured in joules (J)mass (\(\text{m}\)) is measured in kilograms (kg)specific latent heat (\(\text{l}\)) is measured in joules per kilogram (J/kg)QuestionHow much energy is needed to freeze 500 grams (g) of water from 0°C? Reveal answerupdown\(\text{E}\) = \(\text{ml}\)= 0.5 _ 334,000\(\text{E}\) = 167,000 JMeasuring latent heatLatent heat can be measured from a heating or cooling curve line graph. If a heater of known power is used, such as a 60 W immersion heater that provides 60 J/s, the temperature of a known mass of ice can be monitored each second. This will generate a graph that looks like this. The graph is horizontal at two places. These are the places where the energy is not being used to increase the speed of the particles, increasing temperature, but is being used to break the bonds between the particles to change the state. The longer the horizontal line, the more energy has been used to cause the change of state. The amount of energy represented by these horizontal lines relates to the latent heat.ExampleIf a horizontal line that shows boiling on a heating curve is 1 hour 3 minutes long, how much energy has a 60 watt (W) heater provided to the water? 63 minutes = 3,780 s60 W means 60 J of energy is supplied every secondenergy = power _ timeenergy = 60 _ 3,780energy = 226,800 JExample twoIf this energy had caused 100 g of water to evaporate, what is the latent heat of vaporisation of water? 226,800 J for 100 g is equivalent to 2,268,000 J for 1 kg.The latent heat of vaporisation of water is 2,268,000 J/kg.

9,Required practical - determining the specific heat capacity of a metal,"Determining the specific heat capacity of a metalThere are different ways to investigate methods of insulation. In this required practical activity, it is important to:make and record potential difference, current and time accurately measure and observe the change in temperature and energy transferred use appropriate apparatus and methods to measure the specific heat capacity of a sample of materialAim of the experimentTo measure the specific heat capacity of a sample of material.MethodPlace the immersion heater into the central hole at the top of the block.Place the thermometer into the smaller hole and put a couple of drops of oil into the hole to make sure the thermometer is surrounded by hot material.Fully insulate the block by wrapping it loosely with cotton wool.Record the temperature of the block.Connect the heater to the power supply and turn it on for ten minutes taking note of the ammeter and voltmeter readings.After ten minutes the temperature will still rise even though the heater has been turned off and then it will begin to cool. Record the highest temperature that it reaches and calculate the temperature rise during the experiment.ResultsRecord results in a suitable table. The example below shows some suitable results.Ammeter reading (A)Voltmeter reading (V)Initial temperature (°C)Final temperature (°C)3.6510.801538AnalysisThe block has a mass of 1 kg and the heater was running for 10 minutes = 600 seconds.Using the example results:energy transferred = potential difference _ current _ time\[\text{E} = \text{V} \times \text{I} \times \text{t}\]= 10.80 _ 3.65 _ 600\(\text{E}\) = 23,700 J\[\text{E} = \text{mc}\Delta \text{T}\]\[\text{c} = \frac{\text{E}}{\text{m}\Delta \text{T}}\]\[\frac{23,700}{1 \times (38 - 15)}\]\[\frac{23,700}{1 \times (23)}\]\(\text{c}\) = 1,030 J/kg°CThe actual value for the specific heat capacity of aluminium is 900 J/kg°C. The calculated value does not match exactly but it is close to the true value.EvaluationAll experiments are subject to some amount of experimental error due to inaccurate measurement, or variables that cannot be controlled. In this case, not all of the heat from the immersion heater will be heating up the aluminium block, some will be lost to the surroundings.More energy has been transferred than is needed for the block alone as some is transferred to the surroundings, the thermometer and the heater itself. This causes the calculated specific heat capacity to be higher than for one kilogram (kg) of aluminium alone.Hazards and control measuresHazardConsequenceControl measuresHot immersion heater and sample materialBurn skinDo not touch when switched on.

10,Developing models of atoms,"Ideas about atoms have changed over time. Scientists develop new atomic models as they gather new experimental evidence. John Dalton published his ideas about atoms in 1804. He thought that all matter was made of tiny particles called atoms, which he imagined as tiny spheres that could not be divided. Dalton used his atomic model to explain the properties of gases and the formulae of compounds.In 1897, J J Thomson carried out experiments and discovered the electron. The mass of an electron was much smaller than the mass of an atom, so electrons must be subatomic particles. This led him to suggest the plum pudding model of the atom. In this model, the atom is a ball of positive charge with negative electrons embedded in it.The plum pudding modelIn 1911 Ernest Rutherford used results from an experiment to test the plum pudding model. In the experiment, positively charged alpha particles were fired at thin gold foil. Most alpha particles went straight through the foil. But a few were scattered in different directions. The alpha particle scattering experimentThis evidence led Rutherford to suggest a new model for the atom, called the nuclear model. In the nuclear model:the mass of an atom is concentrated at its centre, the nucleusthe nucleus is positively chargedFurther experiments led to the idea that the nucleus contained small particles, called protons. Each proton has a small amount of positive charge.In 1932 James Chadwick found evidence for the existence of particles in the nucleus with mass but no charge. These particles are called neutrons. This led to another development of the atomic model, which is still used today.",Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
11,Structure of the atom,"An atom has a central nucleus. This is surrounded by electrons arranged in shells.The nucleus is tiny compared to the atom as a whole:the radius of an atom is about 0.1 nm (1 _ 10-10 m)the radius of a nucleus (1 _ 10-14 m) is less than \(\frac{1}{10,000}\) of the radius of an atom For comparison, the radius of a methane molecule is 0.5 nm (5 _ 10-10 m), the radius of a typical bacterium is 1 _ 10-6 m and the radius of a human hair is about 1 _ 10-4 m.Subatomic particlesThe nuclei of all atoms contain subatomic particles called protons. The nuclei of most atoms also contain neutrons. The structure of a carbon atom, not drawn to scaleThe masses of subatomic particles are very tiny. Instead of writing their actual masses in kilograms, we often use their relative masses. The relative mass of a proton is 1, and a particle with a relative mass smaller than 1 has less mass.Subatomic particleRelative massRelative chargeProton1+1Neutron10ElectronVery small-1The mass of an electron is very small compared to the mass of a proton or neutron. Since the nucleus contains protons and neutrons, most of the mass of an atom is concentrated in its nucleus.Protons and electrons have equal and opposite electrical charges.curriculum-key-factRemember that Protons are Positive, and Neutrons are Neutral.",Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
12,Atomic number and mass number,"Atomic numberThe number of 
protons in an atom of an element is its 
atomic number. Remember that:all atoms of a given 
element have the same number of protonsatoms of different elements have different numbers of protonsAn atom contains equal number of protons and 
electrons. Since protons and electrons have equal and opposite charges, this means that atoms have no overall electrical charge.For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. Every sodium atom has 11 protons and 11 electrons. It has 11 positive charges and 11 negative charges.Mass numbercurriculum-key-factThe mass number of an atom is its total number of protons and neutrons. Atoms of different elements usually have different mass numbers, but they can be the same. For example, the mass number of both argon atoms and calcium atoms is 40. Calculating numbers of subatomic particlesAtoms can be represented as shown below. The mass number is at the top, and the atomic number at the bottom.The chemical symbol for sodiumTo calculate the numbers of subatomic particles in an atom, use its atomic number and mass number:number of protons = atomic numbernumber of electrons = atomic numbernumber of neutrons = mass number _ atomic numberWorked exampleThe atomic number of a sodium atom is 11 and its mass number is 23. Calculate the number of protons, neutrons and electrons it contains.number of protons = 11number of electrons = 11number of neutrons = (mass number - atomic number) = (23 - 11) = 12A look at how protons, neutrons and electrons make up atoms, and how they tell us the number of subatomic particles that are present in atoms",Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
13,Isotopes,"Atoms of the same element must have the same number of protons, but they can have different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Isotopes of an element have:the same atomic numberdifferent mass numbersThree isotopes of hydrogenAll hydrogen atoms contain one proton (and one electron), but they can contain different numbers of neutrons. Hydrogen-1 is the most common isotope of hydrogen.The three isotopes of hydrogenAll three isotopes of hydrogen have identical chemical properties. This is because the number of electrons determines chemical properties, and all three isotopes have one electron in their atoms.An isotope is named after the element and the mass number of its atoms. For example, carbon-12 is an isotope of carbon with a mass number of 12.An introduction to how protons, neutrons and electrons make up atoms",Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
14,Electronic structure,"An electronic structure is the way in which electrons are arranged in an atom. Electrons in shellsElectrons in atoms occupy energy levels, also called electron shells, outside the nucleus. Different shells can hold different maximum numbers of electrons. The electrons in an atom occupy the lowest available energy level first. This is the shell nearest the nucleus. When this shell is full the electrons begin to occupy the next energy level.Energy level shellMaximum number of electronsFirst2Second8Third8Predicting an electronic structureThe electronic structure of an atom can be predicted from the atom's atomic number.

15,Light microscopes,"Greg Foot explains the main differences between light and electron microscopesCells range in size:most animal cells are between 0.01 mm _ 0.05 mm most plant cells are between 0.01 mm _ 0.10 mmThe human eye can see objects as small as around 0.05 mm. A microscope is required to see cells in any detail.Microscopes magnify the image of a biological specimen so that it appears larger. The type of microscope used in a school laboratory is a compound microscope.Compound microscopeCalculating the magnification of the microscopeThe compound microscope uses two lenses to magnify the specimen _ the eyepiece and an objective lens.In most microscopes, there is a choice of objective lenses to use. Magnification can be varied according to the size of the specimen and the level of detail required.The magnification of a lens is shown by a multiplication sign followed by the amount the lens magnifies, eg _10.curriculum-key-factMagnification of the microscope = magnification of eyepiece _ magnification of objectiveSo, if the magnification of an eyepiece is _10 and the objective is _4, the magnification of the microscope is:magnification of eyepiece _ magnification of objective= 10 _ 4 = 40QuestionIf the magnification of an eyepiece is _10 and the objective is _40, what is the magnification of the microscope?Reveal answerupdown_400.Calculating the magnification of an imageMicroscopes use lenses to magnify the image of a biological specimen so that it appears larger.The formula to calculate magnification is:\[\textup{magnification} = \frac{\textup{size~of~image}}{\textup{real~size~of~object}}\]The formula shown in a magnification triangle",Cells in animals and plants,Cells in animals and plants,Cells in animals and plants,Cells in animals and plants
16,Electron microscopes,"How have light microscopes developed?No-one knows who first invented the microscope but there have been key stages in their development:1590s - Dutch spectacle makers Janssen experimented with putting lenses in tubes. They made the first compound microscope. None of their microscopes have survived, but they are thought to have magnified from _3 to _9.1660s - British scientist, Robert Hooke _ also famous for his law of elasticity in Physics _ observed and drew cells using a compound microscope.previousnextpreviousnextA replica of Robert Hooke's compound microscopepreviousnextAntonie van Leeuwenhoek's first microscope, (17th century)Late 1600s _ Dutch scientist Antonie van Leeuwenhoek constructed a microscope with a single spherical lens. It magnified up to _275.1800s - the optical quality of lenses increased and microscopes are similar to the ones used today.Throughout their development the magnification of light microscopes has increased, but very high magnifications are not possible. The maximum magnification with a light microscope is around _1500 to _2000.The limits of the light microscopeThe magnification of a microscope is not the only factor that's important when viewing cells. The detail that can be seen is also important.The ability to see greater detail in an image depends on the resolution or resolving power. This is the ability to see two points as two points, rather than merged into one.Think about a digital photo. It can be enlarged but over a certain size, you won__ be able to see any more detail. It will just become blurry.The resolution of a light microscope is around 0.2 μm, or 200 nm. This means that it cannot distinguish two points closer than 200 nm. One nm, or nanometre, is one billionth of a metre. This is written as:\(\frac {1}{1~000~000~000}\) m, or in standard form as 1 _ 10-9 m.The electron microscopeElectron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of light rays.There are two types of electron microscope:The scanning electron microscope (SEM) has a large depth of field so it can be used to examine the surface structure of specimens. SEMs are often used at lower magnifications.The transmission electron microscope (TEM) is used to examine thin slices or sections of cells or tissues.TEMs have a maximum magnification of around _1,000,000, but images can be enlarged beyond that photographically. The limit of resolution of the transmission electron microscope is now less than 1 nm.The TEM has revealed structures in cells that are not visible with the light microscope. We can now study cells in much finer detail.",Cells in animals and plants,Cells in animals and plants,Cells in animals and plants,Cells in animals and plants

MitochondriaOrganelles that contain the enzymes for respiration, and where most energy is released in respiration.RibosomesA tiny structure where protein synthesis occurs.Most cells are specialised and are adapted for their function. Animals and plants therefore consist of many different types of cell working together. Most human cells are like most other animal cells.Specialised animal cellsThere are many different types of cells in animals. Each type is specialised for a particular role. These ensure that the organism functions as a whole.The head of the sperm contains the genetic material for fertilisation.The acrosome in the head contains enzymes so that the sperm can penetrate an egg.The middle piece is packed with mitochondria to release energy needed to swim and fertilise the egg.The tail enables the sperm to swim.Sperm cellThe nerve cell is extended, so that nerves can run to and from different parts of the body to the central nervous system.The cell has extensions and branches, so that it can  communicate with other nerve cells, muscles and glands.The nerve cell is covered with a fatty sheath, which insulates the nerve cell and speeds up the nerve impulse.Nerve cellMuscle cells contain filaments of protein that slide over each other to cause muscle contraction. The arrangement of these filaments causes the banded appearance of heart muscle and skeletal muscle.They contain many well-developed mitochondria to provide the energy for muscle contraction.In skeletal muscle, the cells merge and the muscle fibres contract in unison.MuscleAnimal cells can be observed in a laboratory, using a light microscope.",Cells in animals and plants,Combined Science,Cell division,"Energy, rates and reactions"

Each type is specialised to do a particular role and ensures that the organism functions as a whole.The root hair cell has a large surface area to provide contact with soil water.It has thin walls so as not to restrict the movement of water.Root hair cellThere are no top and bottom walls between xylem vessels, so there is a continuous column of water running through them.Their walls become thickened and woody. They therefore support the plant.Xylem cellStrands of cytoplasm run through holes in the sieve plates, connecting the sieve tubes that make up the phloem.Dissolved sugars and amino acids can be transported both up and down the stem.Companion cells, adjacent to the sieve tubes provide energy required to transport substances in the phloem.PhloemPlant cells can be observed in a laboratory, using a light microscope.",Cells in animals and plants,The digestive system,Cells in animals and plants,Transport into and out of cells

21,Measuring cell size,"Cell size can be measured using an eyepiece graticule. The graticule has a scale ruled on it.You must find out the distance measured for each division of the graticule. You can then use the graticule to measure cells. The distance will be different for each objective.To do this, you will use a stage micrometer. You will use this to calibrate the eyepiece graticule. Once it's calibrated, you can use the eyepiece graticule every time you use the microscope.Place a stage micrometer on the stage of the microscope.Line up one of the divisions on the eyepiece graticule with a fixed point on the stage micrometer.Count the number of divisions on the eyepiece graticule that correspond with a set measurement on the stage micrometer.Calculate the distance in micrometres of one division on the eyepiece graticule.The distance of 250 μm on the stage micrometer lines up against two divisions at 10 and 59 on the eyepiece graticule.59 - 10 = 49 divisions on the eyepiece graticule are equivalent to 250 μm on the stage micrometer.One division on the eyepiece graticule is equivalent to \(\frac{250}{49}\) μm on the stage micrometer: 
= 5.1 μm (to two significant figures).Therefore one division is equal to 5.1 μm.Using the same calibrated eyepiece graticule to measure a cell:The width of the cell highlighted = 50 - 40 = 10 eyepiece graticule divisions.The real width of the cell is 10 _ 5.1 μm = 51 μm (to two significant figures).QuestionWhat would be the length of a plant cell, to two significant figures, that was 35 divisions on this graticule?Reveal answerupdown180 μmEach eyepiece graticule division is 5.1 μmThe real width of the cell is 35 _ 5.1 μm = 178.5 μmTo two significant figures, this is 180 μmQuestionHow many graticule divisions would a single celled organism that was 240 μm take up?Reveal answerupdown47Each graticule division is 5.1 μm

23,"Maths - using units, decimals and standard form","Significant figuresSometimes we do not always need to give detailed answers to problems - we just want a rough idea. When we are faced with a long number, we could round it off to the nearest thousand, or nearest million. And when we get a long decimal answer on a calculator, we could round it off to a certain number of decimal places. Another method of giving an approximated answer is to round off using significant figures.The word ""significant"" means ""having meaning"".With the number 368249, the 3 is the most significant digit, because it tells us that the number is 3 hundred thousand and something. It follows that the 6 is the next most significant, and so on.With the number 0.0000058763, the 5 is the most significant digit, because it tells us that the number is 5 millionths and something. The 8 is the next most significant, and so on.Be careful with numbers such as 30245, as the 3 is the first significant figure and 0 the second, because of its value as a place holder.We round off a number using a certain number of significant figures. The most common are 1, 2 or 3 significant figures.Remember the rules for rounding up are the same as before:if the next number is 5 or more, we round upif the next number is 4 or less, we do not round upWhen using significant figures in calculations, we need to take into account the measurements we have made.If measurements have been made to one, two or three significant figures, we cannot have more significant figures in answers to any calculations we make.Using unitsMost animal and plant cells are 0.01 to 0.10 mm in size. The smallest thing seen with the naked eye is about 0.05 mm.For all cells we need a microscope to see them in any detail.The best unit to measure most cells is the micrometre, which has the symbol μm.For some sub-cellular structures, for instance ribosomes, or organisms such as viruses, it__ best to use a smaller unit _ the nanometre.One metre can be broken down into the following measurements:Millimetre, mmMicrometre, μmNanometre, nm\[\frac{1}{1000}\; metre\]\[\frac{1}{1000}\; millimetre\]\[\frac{1}{1000}\; micrometre\]Division of a metre as a fraction\[\frac{1}{1000}\; metre\]\[\frac{1}{1\: 000\: 000}\; metre\]\[\frac{1}{1\: 000\: 000\: 000}\; metre\]Division of a metre in standard form1 _ 10-3 m1 _ 10-6 m1 _ 10-9 mA unit we use in everyday lives is the centimetre, \(\frac{1}{100}\) m, or 1 _ 10-2 m.DecimalsDecimals allow us to clearly identify that a number is not whole. They show us fractions of numbers in a very clear way.So 0.5 is halfway between 0 and 1. 0.25 is one quarter of the way and 0.75 is three quarters.0.1	is a tenth (1 ÷ 10)0.01 is a hundreth (1 ÷ 100)0.001 is a thousandth (1 ÷ 1000)Standard form - HigherWhen writing and working with very large or very small numbers, we use standard form.Standard form shows the size of numbers as powers of 10.curriculum-key-factStandard form numbers are written as:
               A _ 10nA is a number greater than 1 but less than 10n is the index or power, always in powers of 10 Using standard form for large numbersA population of 120 000 000 microorganisms could be written as 1.2 _ 108.This number can be written as 120 000 000.0.If the decimal place is moved eight spaces to the left we get 1.2.So we put _ 108 after 1.2 to show this.It makes a very large number easier to write down.Using standard form for small numbersA red blood cell's diameter of 7 μm or 0.000007 m could be written as 7 _ 10-6 m.This number can be written as 0.000007.If we move the decimal place six spaces to the right we get 7.0.So we put _ 10-6 after 7 to show this.
Because the original number is less than 1 metre, we put a minus sign before the 6.It makes a very small number easier to write down.Calculating the magnification of a cellIn a book, a micrograph of the cell measured 100 mm.The real size of the cell shown is 0.05 mm.To calculate the magnification:\[\textup{magnification} = \frac{100\; \textup{mm}}{0.05\; \textup{mm}} = 2000\]It's important to work in the same units when calculating magnification. Sizes of most cells are given in micrometres, with the symbol μm.To calculate magnification using the same formula in micrometres, convert the measurement of the cell above from millimetres (mm) into micrometres (μm):Cell measurement = 100 mm 1 mm	= 1000 μm 100 mm	= 100 _ 1000 μm 100 mm   = 100 000 μmThe real size of the cell above in micrometres is 50 μm.The magnification of the image:\[\textup{magnification} = \frac{100\; 000 \;  \textup{μm}}{50\;   \textup{μm}} = 2000\]From this, we know that the image has been magnified 2000 times.

24,Maths - orders of magnitude,"Comparing sizesThe diagram shows the size of three organisms, different cells and other structures.Sizes can be compared using a straightforward calculation.For instance, the length of the leaf cell above is 10 times the diameter of a red blood cell.The calculation would be:\[\frac{70~\mu m}{7~\mu m } = 10\]When comparing the size of a bacterium with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), different units have to  be converted to be consistent.The length of the bacterium	=	1 μm	= 1000 nmThe diameter of the HIV		=	100 nmTherefore the length of the bacterium is \(\frac{1000}{100}\) = 10 times that of the bacterium.QuestionWhat is the width of a cheek cell compared with a Salmonella bacterium?Reveal answerupdown140 times the size.Calculation:\[\frac{70~\mu m}{0.5~\mu m} = 140\]Order of magnitudeDifferences in size are often described as differences in order of magnitude. That's the difference calculated in factors of 10.Notation used to write numbers in multiples and sub-multiples of 101000= 10 _ 10 _ 10= 103100= 10 _ 10= 10210= 10= 1011= 1= 1000.1= \[\frac{1}{10}\]= 10-10.01= \[\frac{1}{100}\]= 10-20.001= \[\frac{1}{1000}\]= 10-3If you increase a number by one order of magnitude, you are multiplying the number by 10.If you decrease a number by one order of magnitude, you are dividing the number by 10, which is equivalent to multiplying by 0.1.For instance, there is a one order of magnitude difference between a person 2 m tall, and an oak tree, 20 m tall.The person's height = 2 m = 2 _ 100The oak tree's height = 20 m = 2 _ 101This means there is one order of magnitude between the height of a human being (2 m) and the height of an oak tree (20 m).Notice that when dividing numbers in standard form, we subtract the powers.When comparing orders of magnitude, actual distances can be approximated. It's the relative difference that is important.QuestionWhat is the difference in order of magnitude for a human hair and HIV?The width of a human hair is 100 μm, while the width of the HIV is 100 nm.Reveal answerupdownThe difference in order of magnitude is 3.Calculation:The width of the human hair is 		100 μm	=	10-4 mThe width of the HIV is			100 nm	=	10-7 mSo, there are three orders of magnitude difference:\[\frac{10^{-4}}{10^{-7}} = 3\]Or, more simply:4 - (-7) = -4 + 7 = 3",Cells in animals and plants,Forces,Cells in animals and plants,Plant diseases
25,Diffusion,"Particles in a liquid and a gas move continuously. Because of this movement, particles will spread themselves evenly throughout a liquid or a gas.If there is a situation where particles of a substance are in a higher concentration, they will move from this region to where they are in a lower concentration. This is called diffusion. Diffusion is a spreading out and mixing process.It is important to remember that the particles:will move in both directions, but there will be a net movement from high to low concentrationwill end up evenly spread throughout the liquid or gas, but will continue to moveDiffusion is an essential process in cells. They need glucose and oxygen for respiration, which move into them by diffusion. Respiration produces carbon dioxide and water which leave cells by diffusion. (Water actually leaves cells by osmosis, which is the diffusion of water across a membrane.)Some examples of diffusion in biological systemsSome substances move into and out of living cells by diffusion.In a leafIn the lungsLiver cells",Transport into and out of cells,States of matter,Transport into and out of cells,Combined Science
26,Factors affecting the rate of diffusion,"If a crystal of a coloured chemical, eg potassium manganate(VII), is placed in water, the particles spread out and mix with the water particles.The potassium manganate(VII) is the solute.The water is the solvent.The potassium manganate(VII) has dissolved.The mixture that results is the solution.The particles have moved from a region of high concentration in the crystal to a low concentration in the water. This difference in concentration is called a concentration gradient. Particles will move down a concentration gradient, from a high concentration to a low concentration.As well as diffusion occurring between different regions, it also occurs across membranes, between the outside and inside of cells.The rate of diffusionThe rate of diffusion can be affected by a number of factors:FactorReasonThe concentration gradientThe greater the difference in concentration, the quicker the rate of diffusion.The temperatureThe higher the temperature, the more kinetic energy the particles will have, so they will move and mix more quickly.The surface area of the cell membrane separating the different regionsThe greater the surface area, the faster the rate of diffusion.Diffusion, surface area and volumeFor a bacterium, substances diffuse into and out of the bacterial cell across its surface. Once inside, because of the bacterium's size, substances will need to diffuse 1 μm or less to where they are needed, for example, for respiration.For simple multicellularorganisms, such as small plants like mosses, substances diffuse into the leaves and roots over their surface. Again, once inside the plant, they don't need to move far.Substances move into and around the moss plants by diffusion and osmosis.Simple organisms take in substances over their body surface. Their needs are determined by their volume. As organisms increase in size, their surface area does not increase at the same rate as their volume. For example, the surface area to volume ratio of a puppy is several times greater than that of an adult dog.QuestionSuggest why puppies are more at risk of losing body heat than adult dogs.Reveal answerupdownDogs lose heat over their body surface.Puppies have a larger surface area to volume ratio than adult dogs, so will lose heat more readily.

27,Osmosis,"Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules, from a region where the water molecules are in higher concentration, to a region where they are in lower concentration, through a partially permeable membrane.A dilute solution contains a high concentration of water molecules, while a concentrated solution contains a low concentration of water molecules.curriculum-key-factOsmosis refers to the movement of water molecules only.The slideshow shows an example of osmosis showing the direction of movement of water between two different concentrations of sugar solutions.previousnextpreviousnextStep oneThe beaker contains water and sugar moleculespreviousnextStep twoWater molecules pass through from solution 1 to solution 2When the concentration of water is the same on both sides of the membrane, the movement of water molecules will be the same in both directions. There will be no net movement of water molecules. In theory, the level of solution two will rise, but this will be opposed by gravity and will be dependent on the width of the container.Similar observations will be made with solutions containing different solutes, for instance, salt instead of sugar.Osmosis across living cellsCells contain dilute solutions of ions, sugars and amino acids.The cell membrane is partially permeable. It allows small molecules such as water through but not larger molecules. Water may move into and out of cells by osmosis.Plant cellsIsolated plant cells placed in a dilute solution or water will take in water by osmosis. Root hair cells, if the soil is wet or moist, will also take up water by osmosis. Leaf cells of land plants, unless it is raining or the humidity is high, will have a tendency to lose water.Plant cells have a strong cellulose cell wall outside the cell membrane.  The cell wall is fully permeable to all molecules and supports the cell and stops it bursting when it gains water by osmosis.If plant cells are placed in solutions of increasing solute concentration:Pure waterIn pure water, the cell contents (the cytoplasm and vacuole) push against the cell wall and the cell becomes turgid.Fully turgid cells support the stems of non-woody plants.Concentrated solutionIn a more concentrated solution, the cell contents lose water by osmosis. They shrink and pull away from the cell wall. The cell becomes flaccid. It is becoming plasmolysed.Highly-concentrated solutionIn a very concentrated solution, the cell undergoes full plasmolysis as the cells lose more water.Plants would be exposed to higher concentrations of solutes if there was less water in the soil - for instance, if plants were not watered, or plants in drought conditions. Plant cells would then lose water by osmosis.Aquatic, freshwater plants placed in the sea, or a seaweed in a rock pool where the water evaporated in the Sun, would also lose water by osmosis.Animal cellsAnimal cells also take in and lose water by osmosis. They do not have a cell wall, so will change size and shape when put into solutions that are at a different concentration to the cell contents.For example, red blood cells could:lose water and shrink in concentrated solutionsgain water, swell and burst in a more dilute solutionIn animals, the concentration of body fluids _ blood plasma and tissue fluid _ must be kept within strict limits _ if cells lose or gain too much water by osmosis, they do not function efficiently.",Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells
28,Required practical - investigating osmosis,"Scientists investigate the effects of osmosis on living cells. They either:Observe (with a microscope),cells or  tissues placed in solutions of different concentration.Measure changes in cylinders or discs of fresh potato or beetroot. Cylinders will have a larger mass than discs, so scientists will have larger measurements to work with.The following experiment investigates the effect of different concentrations of sucrose on potato tissue. It could also be carried out using salt _ sodium chloride solution _ instead of sucrose.Aims of the experimentTo investigate the effect of a range of sucrose solutions on the mass of potato cylinders.To determine the concentration of the cell sap of potato cells.ApparatusBoiling tubesBeakersDistilled waterSucrose solutionPotato cylinders (or potato and cork borer)Electronic balanceMethodPrepare a range of sucrose (sugar) solutions. The concentration of a solution is measured in moles per cubic decimetre written as mol dm-3. For example, in this experiment your range could be from 0.2 mol dm-3 to 1.0 mol dm-3.
                                                
A 1.0 mol dm-3 solution of sucrose will contain up to 342 g of sucrose per dm-3. A 1.0 mol dm-3 solution of a substance contains one mole of the substance per dm3 of a solution, or one mole per litre of solution.Set up a series of boiling tubes with each of these solutions. Also, set up one containing distilled water. This will have a concentration of sucrose of 0.0 mol dm-3 and will act as the control in the experiment.Make sure each tube is labelled with the concentration.Carry out the investigation. Prepare a blank results table before you begin. Make sure when weighing the potato cylinders, that their masses are not mixed up when recording them. Each cylinder will have a different mass before and after the investigation.For each sucrose concentration, repeat the investigation for several potato cylinders. This allows you to make the experiment more repeatable _ not all potato cylinders might behave in the same way. Making a series of repeat experiments means that any anomalous results can be identified and ignored when a mean is calculated.RisksMake sure that the potato is placed on a ceramic tile when using the cork borer - do not cut the potato cylinders towards your hand.Care must be taken when using the scalpel.Wear eye protection when using chemical solutions.This experiment shows the effect of osmosis on plant tissue. The cylinders will decrease or increase in mass if they lose or gain water by osmosis.The effects on plant tissues at a cellular level can be observed using a microscope. Another way of looking at osmosis in plant cells is to mount a piece of onion skin or beetroot on microscope slides in drops of different concentrations of sugar or salt.

31,Active transport,"Substances are transported passively down concentration gradients. Often, substances have to be moved from a low to a high concentration - against a concentration gradient.Active transport is a process that is required to move molecules against a concentration gradient. The process requires energy from respiration.Plants need to absorb mineral ions from the soil to keep healthy. They need to absorb them from a low concentration in the soil to a higher concentration in the plant. This is against a concentration gradient, so it will not happen naturally like diffusion and osmosis. Plants therefore use active transport to absorb mineral ions into root hair cells.Animals, including humans, need to absorb all glucose molecules from their food. This is taken from the gut wall, inside the small intestine, into the blood. There is more glucose (a higher concentration of glucose) in the intestine than the blood after having just eaten a sugary meal. So, the glucose moves from high concentration in the small intestine to lower concentration in the blood by diffusion.However, after a short while there is the same or more glucose in the blood, so there is a low concentration of glucose in the intestine. Now glucose cannot move into the blood by diffusion. This is against a concentration gradient, so it will not happen naturally. Animals therefore use active transport to absorb glucose into the blood under these conditions. The process requires energy produced by respiration.",Transport into and out of cells,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells

33,Chromosomes in the cell nucleus,"The genetic material in the nucleus of a cell is composed of a chemical called DNA. DNA is a polymer, a large and complex molecule. It is made up of two strands forming a twisted ladder structure called a double helix. It carries the genetic code, which determines the characteristics of a living organism.Except for identical twins, each person's DNA is unique. This is why people can be identified using DNA fingerprinting. DNA can be cut up and separated, which can form a 'barcode' that is different from one person to the next.DNA exists in a cell's nucleus within structures called chromosomes. Each section of a chromosome that contains the code for the production of a particular protein is called a gene.Each chromosome is made from a single molecule of DNA, but when a cell is ready to divide, the DNA copies itself, then coils and condenses to form the chromosomes that we see in micrographs.Each human body cell contains 46 chromosomes. These can be arranged into 23 pairs. Each chromosome in a pair carries the same types of genes. The 23rd pair are the sex chromosomes:In females, the two chromosomes are identical in shape. There are two X chromosomes. Females are referred to as XX.In males, one of the chromosomes is a different in shape. There is an X and also a Y chromosome. Males are referred to as XY.",Cell division,Cell division,Cell division,Inheritance
34,Mitosis and the cell cycle,"Greg Foot explains the process of mitosis in growth and asexual reproductionMulticellular organisms need cells to divide so that organisms can grow and repair damaged tissue.Cells divide when: an organism grows an organism becomes damaged and needs to produce new cellsIt is essential that any new cells produced contain genetic information that is identical to the parent cell.The cell cycleA growing and dividing cell goes through a series of stages called the cell cycle.The first stages of the cell cycle involve cell growth, then synthesis of DNA. The single strand of DNA that makes up each chromosome produces an exact copy of itself.The cell undergoes a type of cell division called mitosis.Before a cell can divide, it must grow and make copies of all the organelles such as mitochondria and ribosomes. The cell must also replicate the chromosomes in the nucleus, then it can divide by mitosis.During mitosis, the two complete sets of chromosomes are pulled to opposite sides of the cell. Two new nuclei form. Then the cell splits into two daughter cells. These are both genetically identical to the parent cell.",Cell division,Cell division,Cell division,Cell division
35,Meiosis,"This short video explains the role of meiotic cell divisionSexual reproduction uses the process of meiosis, which creates gametes. These are sperm and eggs (ova) in animals, and pollen and ova in plants.The process of meiosis happens in the male and female reproductive organs. As a cell divides to form gametes:copies of the genetic information are madethe cell divides twice to form four gametes, each with a single set of chromosomesgametes are haploidall gametes are genetically different from each otherDuring fertilisation, two haploid gametes fuse to form one diploid cell. This will divide by mitosis to form an organism.Meiosis occurs in the testes of men and ovaries of women.Meiosis and mitosis differ because:mitosis is a form of cell division which produces two identical, diploid body cellsmeiosis is a form of cell division which produces four non-identical, haploid sex cells or gametes (sperm and ova in humans)",Cell division,Cell division,Cell division,Cell division
36,Cell differentiation,"Newly formed cells are undifferentiated. That is, they are stem cells and have not yet become specialised in a process called cell differentiation.Large, multicellular organisms like humans are made from many different cell types. There are over 200 specialised cells in our bodies. So, stem cells must differentiate so that they develop the features that enable them to fulfil their specific roles.

An embryo develops from a fertilised egg. Cells at early stages in the development of the embryo are stem cells.If cells are removed from the embryo _ called embryonic stem cells _ they will differentiate into any cell type.Some stem cells remain in the bodies of adults _ adult stem cells.Adult stem cells are found in limited numbers at certain locations in the body, including the:braineyesbloodheartliverbone marrowskinmuscleAdult stem cells can differentiate into related cell types only, for example, bone marrow cells can differentiate into blood cells and cells of the immune system but not other cell types.Stem cells in plantsCell division in plants occurs in regions called meristems.Cells of the meristem can differentiate to produce all types of plant cells at any time during the life of the plant.The main meristems are close to the tip of the shoot, and the tip of the root.In a growing shoot, new cells are being produced continuously near the tip. As the cells become older, further away from the tip, they become differentiated _ they enlarge and develop vacuoles.",Cell division,Cell division,Cell division,Cell division
37,Properties of waves ,"Waves are one of the ways in which energy may be transferred between stores. Waves can be described as oscillations, or vibrations about a rest position. For example:sound waves cause air particles to vibrate back and forthripples cause water particles to vibrate up and downThe direction of these oscillations is the difference between longitudinal or transverse waves. In longitudinal waves, the vibrations are parallel to the direction of wave travel. In transverse waves, the vibrations are at right angles to the direction of wave travel.Mechanical waves travel through matter. They cause oscillations of particles in a solid, liquid or gas. The material through which they travel is called  a medium. Electromagnetic waves cause oscillations in electrical and magnetic fields. They do not need matter to travel through.curriculum-key-factAll waves transfer energy but they do not transfer matter.Parts of a waveWaves are described using the following terms:Rest position - the undisturbed position of particles or fields when they are not vibrating.Displacement - the distance that a certain point in the medium has moved from its rest position.Peak - the highest point above the rest position.Trough - the lowest point below the rest position.Amplitude - the maximum displacement of a point of a wave from its rest position.Wavelength - distance covered by a full cycle of the wave. Usually measured from peak to peak, or trough to trough.Time period - the time taken for a full cycle of the wave. Usually measured from peak to peak, or trough to trough.Frequency - the number of waves passing a point each second.Diagram of a waveWave period and wave speed The time period of a wave can be calculated using the equation:\[\text{Time period} = \frac{1}{\text{frequency}}\]\[\text{T} = \frac{1}{\text{f}}\]This is when:time period (T) is measured in seconds (s)frequency (f) is measured in hertz (Hz)Example calculationCalculate the time period of a wave with a frequency of 50 Hz.\[\text{T} = \frac{1}{\text{f}}\]\[\text{T} = \frac{1}{50}\]\(\text{T}\) = 0.02 s QuestionCalculate the time period of a wave with a frequency of 400 Hz.Reveal answerupdown\[\text{T} = \frac{1}{400}\]\(\text{T}\) = 0.0025 s Calculating wave speedThe speed of a wave is how fast the wave moves through the medium.The speed of a wave can be calculated using the equation:wave speed = frequency _ wavelength\[\text{v} = \text{f \lambda}\]This is when:wave speed (v) is measured in metres per second (m/s)frequency (f) is measured in hertz (Hz)wavelength (λ) is measured in metres (m)Example calculationWhat is the speed of a wave that has a frequency of 50 Hz and a wavelength of 6 m?\[\text{v} = \text{f \lambda}\]\(\text{v}\) = 50 _ 6\(\text{v}\) = 300 m/sQuestionWhat is the speed of a wave with a frequency of 0.2 Hz and a wavelength of 25 m?Reveal answerupdown\[\text{v} = \text{f \lambda }\]\(\text{v}\) = 0.2 _ 25\(\text{v}\) = 5 m/s",Waves,Waves,Waves,Building blocks

A ripple tank is a transparent shallow tray of water with a light shining down through it onto a white card below to more easily see the motion of the ripples created on the water's surface. Ripples can be made by hand but to generate regular ripples it is better to use a motor.Aim of the experimentTo measure the frequency, wavelength and speed of waves in a ripple tank.MethodSet up the ripple tank as shown in the diagram with roughly 1 cm depth of water.Adjust the height of the wooden rod so that it just touches the surface of the water.Switch on the lamp and motor and adjust until low frequency waves can be clearly observed.Measure the length of a number of waves then divide by the number of waves to record wavelength.

Instead, they move backwards and forwards between compressions and rarefactions as the wave is transmitted through the medium.",Waves,Waves,Waves,Building blocks
42,Electromagnetic waves,"Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves. Their vibrations or oscillations are changes in electrical and magnetic fields at right angles to the direction of wave travel.All electromagnetic waves:transfer energy as radiation from the source of the waves to an absorbercan travel through a vacuum such as in spacetravel at the same speed through a vacuum or the airElectromagnetic waves travel at 300 million metres per second (m/s) through a vacuum.Electromagnetic spectrumElectromagnetic waves form a continuous spectrum of waves. This includes:waves with a very short wavelength, high frequency and high energywaves with a very long wavelength, low frequency and low energyDifferent parts of the electromagnetic spectrum interact with matter in different ways and have different uses as a result. This causes electromagnetic waves to be separated into seven distinct groups in the spectrum.The electromagnetic spectrumEach group contains a range of frequencies. For example, visible light contains all the frequencies that can be detected by the human eye:red light has the lowest frequencies of visible lightviolet light has the highest frequencies of visible lightThe wave equation is still used when working with electromagnetic waves. The principle is still the same but the numbers can be very large or very small.Example: The speed of light is 300,000,000 m/s or 3 _ 108 m/s. A radio station broadcasts with a wavelength of about 200 m. What is the frequency of this wave?Frequency = speed ÷ wavelength = 300,000,000 ÷ 200 = 1,500,000 Hz or 1.5 MHzExample: Red light has frequency of 5 _ 1014 Hz. What is its wavelength?Wavelength = speed ÷ frequency = 3 _ 108 ÷ 5 _ 1014 = 6 _ 10-7 mBehaviour and uses of electromagnetic wavesThe behaviour of an electromagnetic wave in a substance depends on its frequency. The differing behaviours of different groups in the electromagnetic spectrum make them suitable for a range of uses.Radio wavesRadio waves are used for communication such as television and radio.MicrowavesMicrowaves are used for cooking food and for satellite communications.InfraredInfrared light is used by electrical heaters, cookers for cooking food, and by infrared cameras which detect people in the dark.Visible lightVisible light is the light we can see. It is used in fibre optic communications, where coded pulses of light travel through glass fibres from a source to a receiver.UltravioletWe cannot see ultraviolet light but it can have hazardous effects on the human body. Ultraviolet light in sunlight can cause the skin to tan or burn. Fluorescent substances are used in energy-efficient lamps - they absorb ultraviolet light produced inside the lamp, and re-emit the energy as visible light.Electromagnetic waves in medicineChanges in atoms and their nuclei can cause electromagnetic waves to be generated or absorbed. Gamma rays are produced by changes in the nucleus of an atom. They are a form of nuclear radiation. High energy waves such as x-rays and gamma rays are transmitted through body tissues with very little absorption. This makes them ideal for internal imaging. X-rays are absorbed by dense structures like bones, which is why x-ray photos are used to help identify broken bones.Ionising radiationUltraviolet waves, x-rays and gamma rays are types of ionising radiation. They can add or remove electrons from molecules, producing electrically charged ions. Ionisation can have hazardous effects on the body, such as:ultraviolet waves can cause skin to age prematurely and increase the risk of skin cancer x-rays and gamma rays can cause the mutation of genes, which can lead to cancerRadio waves - Higher Radio waves are transmitted easily through air. They do not cause damage if absorbed by the human body, and they can be reflected to change their direction. These properties make them ideal for communications.Radio waves can be produced by oscillations in electrical circuits. When radio waves are absorbed by a conductor, they create an alternating current. This electric current has the same frequency as the radio waves. Information is coded into the wave before transmission, which can then be decoded when the wave is received. Television and radio systems use this principle to broadcast information.",Waves,Radiation and risk,Waves,Waves

It is important to:use appropriate apparatus to measure and record temperature accuratelymake observations regarding the effects of electromagnetic waves on different substancesThe method described here uses a Leslie cube. This is a metal cube with four different types of surface. It is filled with hot water to increase its temperature.Aim of the experimentTo investigate how the amount of infrared radiation absorbed or radiated by a surface depends on the nature of that surface.MethodPlace a Leslie cube on a heat-resistant mat.

44,Reflection of waves - Higher,"Waves - including sound and light - can be reflected at the boundary between two different materials. The reflection of sound causes echoes.The law of reflection states that: angle of incidence = angle of reflectionFor example, if a light ray hits a surface at 32°, it will be reflected at 32°.The angles of incidence and reflection are measured between the light ray and the normal - an imaginary line at 90° to the surface. The diagram shows a light ray being reflected at a plane mirror.Specular reflectionReflection from a smooth, flat surface is called specular reflection. This is the type of reflection that happens with a flat mirror. The image in a mirror is:uprightvirtualIn a virtual image, the rays appear to diverge from behind the mirror, so the image appears to come from behind the mirror.A ray diagram showing how an image forms in a plane mirrorDiffuse reflectionIf a surface is rough, diffuse reflection happens. Instead of forming an image, the reflected light is scattered in all directions. This may cause a distorted image of the object, as occurs with rippling water, or no image at all. Each individual reflection still obeys the law of reflection, but the different parts of the rough surface are at different angles.Diffuse reflection or scattering from a rough surface",Waves,Combined Science,Waves,Water
45,Refraction of waves - Higher,"Different materials have different densities. Light waves may change direction at the boundary between two transparent materials. Refraction is the change in direction of a wave at such a boundary.It is important to be able to draw ray diagrams to show the refraction of a wave at a boundary.A ray diagram showing refraction at the boundary between air and glassRefraction can cause optical illusions as the light waves appear to come from a different position to their actual source.Explaining refraction The density of a material affects the speed that a wave will be transmitted through it. In general, the denser the transparent material, the more slowly light travels through it.Glass is denser than air, so a light ray passing from air into glass slows down. If the ray meets the boundary at an angle to the normal, it bends towards the normal.The reverse is also true. A light ray speeds up as it passes from glass into air, and bends away from the normal by the same angle.previousnextpreviousnextpreviousnextpreviousnextcurriculum-key-factA useful way of remembering the speed and direction changes of light during refraction is 'FAST': Faster - Away, Slower - Towards.Wave speed, frequency and wavelength in refractionFor a given frequency of light, the wavelength is proportional to the wave speed:wave speed = frequency _ wavelengthSo if a wave slows down, its wavelength will decrease. The effect of this can be shown using wave front diagrams  like the one below. The diagram shows that as wave travels into a denser medium, such as water, it slows down and wavelength decreases. Although the wave slows down, its frequency remains the same, due to the fact that its wavelength is shorter. In this diagram, the nearest to the water side of the incoming wave slows down before the furthest side does. This causes the wave to change direction. ",Waves,Waves,Waves,Waves

for movement _ in animals, energy is needed to make muscles contract, while in plants, it is needed for transport of substances in the phloemfor keeping warm in warm-blooded organismsRespiration is only around 40% efficient. As animals respire, heat is also released. In birds and mammals, this heat is distributed around the body by the blood. It keeps these animals warm and helps to keep a constant internal temperature.Energy is also used:for cell divisionto maintain constant conditions in cells and the body _ homeostasisto move molecules against concentration gradients in active transportfor the transmission of nerve impulses",Respiration,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Transport into and out of cells,Respiration
47,Aerobic respiration,"Respiration using oxygen to break down food molecules is called aerobic respiration. Glucose is the molecule normally used for respiration _ it is the main respiratory substrate. Glucose is oxidised to release its energy.The word equation for aerobic respiration is:glucose + oxygen _ carbon dioxide + water + energy releasedThe reactants in this reaction are glucose and oxygen. The products are carbon dioxide and water.Symbol equation - HigherYou need to be able to recognise the chemical symbols:C6H12O6 + 6O2 _ 6CO2 + 6H2ORespiration is a series of reactions, but this summarises the overall process.The first stages of respiration occur in the cytoplasm of cells, but most of the energy released is in the mitochondria.",Respiration,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Respiration,Respiration
48,Anaerobic respiration,"Anaerobic respiration in animalsMost organisms cannot respire without oxygen but some organisms and tissues, including muscles, can continue to respire if the oxygen runs out. These organisms and tissues use the process of anaerobic respiration.During anaerobic respiration, the oxidation of glucose is incomplete. The reaction releases much less energy _ around 1/19th of the energy released during aerobic respiration.Human muscle can respire anaerobically for short periods of time _ even though the process is relatively inefficient, it's better to continue respiring and be able to run away from danger _ or run a race.The glucose in muscle is converted to lactic acid:glucose _ lactic acid + energy releasedThe reactant in this reaction is glucose. The product is lactic acid.During long periods of vigorous activity:lactic acid levels build upglycogen reserves in the muscles become low as more glucose is used for respiration, and additional glucose is transported from the liverAs body stores of glycogen become low, the person suffers from muscle fatigue.Oxygen debtWhen a period of exercise is over, lactic acid must be removed from the body. The body's tolerance of lactic acid is limited.Lactic acid is taken to the liver by the blood, and either:oxidised to carbon dioxide and water, orconverted to glucose, then glycogen - glycogen levels in the liver and muscles can then be restoredThese processes require oxygen. This is why, when the period of activity is over, a person__ breathing rate and heart rate do not return to normal straightaway.The amount of oxygen required to remove the lactic acid, and replace the body's reserves of oxygen, is called the oxygen debt. When someone who has been exercising pays back an oxygen debt, it can take between a few hours for normal exercise, to several days after a marathon.Anaerobic respiration in fungi and plantsSome plants and fungi such as yeast can respire anaerobically _ it's preferable to release less energy but remain alive.Glucose in yeast cells is converted to carbon dioxide and ethanol, which we refer to simply as 'alcohol':glucose _ ethanol + carbon dioxide + energy releasedThe reactant in this reaction is glucose. The products are ethanol and carbon dioxide.Anaerobic respiration is economically important _ many foods are produced by microorganisms respiring anaerobically.Yeast is used to make alcoholic drinks. When yeast cells are reproducing rapidly during beer or wine production, the oxygen runs out. The yeast switches to anaerobic respiration. Ethanol and carbon dioxide are produced.Yeast can also be used to produce bread. Yeast respires using sugar added to the dough. Bubbles of carbon dioxide make the bread rise. The alcohol that is produced evaporates as the bread is baked.

50,Surface area to volume ratio,"Organisms must take in food, oxygen and water, and other essential substances, from the environment. Plants also need carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Organisms also need to remove waste substances.Small organisms exchange these essential and waste substances between themselves and the environment. They do this over their body surface. Simple chemical substances can diffuse in and out of their bodies.Inside their bodies, in small organisms, substances don't have to move far.The size of their surface, or surface area, defines how quickly they can absorb substances.
The size of their volume defines how much of these substances they need.
Modelling cellsIf we represent the cell of an organism by a cube:This is what happens when the cube increases in size:As the volume increases, surface area does not increase at the same rate.As multicellular organisms increase in size, they face two problems:ProblemSolution to the problemTheir surface area does not increase as fast as the volumeInsufficient surface area to meet their needsBody systems that add additional absorbing area to exchange surfacesTheir volume increasesDiffusion is not quick enough to move substances to where they're needed in the organism's bodyA transport system",Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Transport into and out of cells,States of matter,Transport over larger distances
51,Exchange surfaces,"Single-celled organisms have relative large surface area to volume ratios. Larger multicellular organisms have smaller surface area to volume ratios. So, they have evolved exchange surfaces to exchange molecules with their surroundings. The effectiveness of exchange surfaces in plants and animals is increased by having:A large surface area:the flattened shape of structures such as leavesthe alveoli in the respiratory systemthe villi in the digestive systemA short distance required fordiffusion:the membranes of cellsthe flattened shape of structures such as leavesthe walls of blood capillaries are one cell thickthe epithelia of alveoli in the respiratory system and the villi in the small intestine are only one cell thickLarge, flat leaves like this green taro leaf have an effective exchange surfaceAnimals have additional adaptations for effective exchange surfaces.An efficient blood supply to transport molecules to and from the exchange surface increases effective exchange. Examples of this include:the network of blood capillaries that surrounds each of the alveoli in the lungsthe network of blood capillaries in each of the villi in the small intestineCross section of one of the villiThe process of breathing, or ventilation, brings air to, and removes air from the exchange surface _ the alveoli.The moving blood and ventilated surfaces mean that a steep concentration gradient can be maintained. This increases effective exchange.",Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Transport into and out of cells
52,The lungs,"The human lungs provide an exchange surface adapted for:absorbing oxygen _ needed for respiration _ into the blood from the airtransferring carbon dioxide _ produced by respiration _ from the blood into the lungs then the airThe transfer of these two gases between organisms and their environment is called gas exchange.The lungs are organs enclosed within the chest or thorax. Air needs to be breathed in to be brought into contact with the exchange surfaces within the lungs. This process is called ventilation.The structure of the respiratory system The human respiratory system is adapted to allow air to pass in and out of the body, and for efficient gas exchange to happen.The lungs are enclosed in the thorax, surrounded and protected by 12 pairs of ribs. The ribs are moved by two sets of intercostal muscles. There is a muscular diaphragm below the lungs. The lungs are sealed within two airtight pleural membranes. These wrap around the lungs and line the rib cage.The trachea, or windpipe, branches into two bronchi _ one bronchus to each lung. Rings of cartilage in the walls of the trachea help to keep it open as air is drawn in.The bronchi split into smaller branches and then into smaller tubes called bronchioles. Each bronchiole ends in a cluster of microscopic air sacs called alveoli.Gaseous exchangeThe exchange of gases occurs between the alveoli and blood in the capillaries that supply the lungs. Capillaries cover 70% of the outside of alveoli, providing a large surface area for gases to diffuse across.In cross section:The alveoli are adapted to provide a very large surface area for gaseous exchange:small size - each of the alveoli is a small sphere about 300 μm in diameter, giving it a larger surface area to volume ratio than larger structuresnumber - there are around 700 million alveoli _ ie 350 million per lungThe total surface area of the alveoli is around 70 square metres.There is also a short diffusion path - the walls of blood capillaries and alveoli are just one cell thick. The alveoli are also lined with a thin film of moisture. Gases dissolve in this water, making the diffusion path even smaller.The ventilation of the lungs and the blood flow through the surrounding capillaries mean gases are being removed continually, and steep concentration gradients are set up for gases to diffuse.",Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems
53,The heart,"Blood is pumped around the body by the heart.curriculum-key-factBiologists often show oxygenated blood as red, and deoxygenated blood as blue. This is just a way of illustrating it in biological diagrams. It's also helpful in showing the different regions of the heart, and different blood vessels that carry oxygenated or deoxygenated blood.The heart has four chambers - two atria and two ventricles.curriculum-key-factNote that left and right refers to the side in the person's body, not how it is viewed on the page.Blood enters the heart through the atria. Blood from two vena cavae enters the right atrium. Blood from the pulmonary veins enters the left atrium. The atria fill, followed by the ventricles. Blood is prevented from flowing back into the atria by heart valves.Blood leaves the heart in the body's main artery - the aorta - from the left side, and the pulmonary artery, from the right.Double circulationHumans have a double circulatory system. The heart pumps blood through two circuits:the pulmonary circulationthe systemic circulationThe pulmonary circulation transports blood to the lungs. At the lungs:oxygendiffuses into the blood from the alveoli - the blood becomes oxygenatedcarbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungsThe systemic circulation transports:oxygen and nutrients to the bodycarbon dioxide and other wastes away from cellsThe systemic circulation is under high pressure - it has to deliver blood to the extremities of the body.The pulmonary circulation is under lower pressure, because:blood is delivered to the lungs only, which are very close to the heartin a healthy person, this lower pressure is optimum for the diffusion of gasesCirculating bloodBlood passes through the heart twice in one complete circulation of the body.Following the blood through one complete circulation of the body:previousnextpreviousnext1. Deoxygenated blood from the body enters the right atriumpreviousnext2. Blood passes from the right atrium to the right ventricle, then to the lungspreviousnext3. Oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the left atriumpreviousnext4. Blood passes into the left ventricle, through the aorta and into the bodyNote that although this is shown as a sequence, the atria contract in unison, and when full, the ventricles also contract in unison.Part of the blood is being delivered to the body, while the remainder of the blood is being transported to the lungs. This means that oxygen can be picked up from the lungs, while at the same time, blood is also being delivered to the body.",Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems
54,Control of the heart rate,"The heart beatSpecialised cells in the right atrium generate electrical signals that make the heart contract independently of the nervous system. These specialised cells act as a natural pacemaker.A wave of contraction spreads across the heart - to the left atrium and then to the ventricles. This enables the ventricles to contract together.The arrows show how the wave of contraction spreads across the heart - to the left atrium and then to the ventriclesArtificial pacemakersSometimes, the rhythm of the heart's natural pacemaker process becomes disrupted - a person's heart beats abnormally. It can be abnormally slow or fast, or irregular.An artificial pacemaker is a small, battery-operated electronic device implanted in a person's chest that sends out regular, adjustable electrical impulses to produce normal contractions of the heart.There are several types of artificial pacemaker, which have electrical leads connected to different chambers of the heart.Wires are guided along a vein to the chamber of the heart that needs to be stimulated. The lead extends to the pacemaker, which is fitted between the skin of the upper chest and the chest muscle.The fitting of artificial pacemakers is one of the most common types of heart surgery performed in the UK.X-ray of the chest of a patient, showing a fitted heart pacemaker",Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Transport over larger distances
55,The blood vessels,"Blood is transported in arteries, veins and capillaries.Blood is pumped from the heart in the arteries. It is returned to the heart in the veins.The capillaries connect the two types of blood vessel, and molecules are exchanged between the blood and the cells across their walls.Arteries carry blood away from the heartArteriesVeinsAlways carry blood away from the heartAlways carry blood to the heartCarry oxygenated blood, except for the pulmonary arteryAlways carry deoxygenated blood, except for the pulmonary veinCarry blood under high pressureCarry blood under low or negative pressureHave thick muscular and elastic walls to pump and accommodate bloodHave thin walls - have less muscular tissue than arteriesA type of supporting tissue called connective tissue provides strengthHave less connective tissue than arteriesThe channel in the blood vessel that carries blood - the lumen - is narrowHave a wide lumenCapillariesCapillaries connect the smallest branches of arteries and veins.The walls of capillaries are just one cell thick. Capillaries therefore allow the exchange of molecules between the blood and the body's cells - molecules can diffuse across their walls. This exchange of molecules is not possible across the walls of other types of blood vessel.Exchange of moleculesOxygen diffuses through the capillary wall, into the tissue fluid, and the cells.Carbon dioxide diffuses from the cells into the tissue fluid, then across the capillary walls into the blood plasma.Glucose diffuses from the blood plasma, across the capillary walls to the tissue fluid, and then to the cells.The waste product urea diffuses from the cells of the liver to the tissue fluid, and then across the capillary walls into the blood plasma.",Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems
56,Blood,"The composition of bloodBlood transports materials and distributes heat around the body. It also helps to protect against disease. Blood contains plasma, which is a liquid that cells and cell fragments are suspended in.Plasma is a straw-coloured liquid that makes up just over half the volume of blood.Types of blood cell and cell fragments:red blood cellswhite blood cellsplateletsThis table explains the functions of various blood components.ComponentFunction(s)PlasmaTransporting carbon dioxide, digested food molecules, urea and hormones;  distributing heatRed blood cellsTransporting oxygenWhite blood cellsIngesting pathogens and producing antibodiesPlateletsInvolved in blood clottingRed blood cellsRed blood cells transport the oxygen required for aerobic respiration in body cells.They must be able to absorb oxygen in the lungs, pass through narrow blood capillaries, and release this oxygen to respiring cells.Red blood cells have adaptations that enable them to carry a maximum amount of oxygen. They contain the protein haemoglobin, which gives them their red colour.\[\textup{haemoglobin}+\textup{oxygen} \xrightarrow[]{\textup{at~the~lungs}} \textup{oxyhaemoglobin}\]\[\textup{haemoglobin}+\textup{oxygen} \xleftarrow[\textup{at~the~cells}]{ } \textup{oxyhaemoglobin}\]Haemoglobin can combine reversibly with oxygen. This is important - it means that it can combine with oxygen as blood passes through the lungs, and release the oxygen when it reaches the cells.Red blood cells have no nucleus - they lose it during their development - so they can pack in more haemoglobin.They are small and flexible so that they can fit through narrow blood capillaries.They have a biconcave shape - they are the shape of a disc that is curved inwards on both sides -  to maximise their surface area for oxygen absorption.They are thin, so there is only a short distance for the oxygen to diffuse to reach the centre of the cell.Red blood cellsWhite blood cellsThere are several main types of white blood cell.PhagocytesAbout 70% of white blood cells are phagocytes.  Phagocytes engulf and destroy unwanted microorganisms that enter the blood, by the process of phagocytosis.
They are part of the body's immune system.LymphocytesLymphocyteLymphocytes make up about 25% of white blood cells. They are also part of the body's immune system. Lymphocytes produce soluble proteins called antibodies when a foreign body such as a microorganism enters the body.PlateletsPlatelets are cell fragments produced by giant cells in the bone marrow.Platelets stop bleeding in two main ways:they have proteins on their surface that enable them to stick to breaks in a blood vessel and clump togetherthey secrete proteins that result in a series of chemical reactions that make blood clot, which plugs a woundBlood productsBlood products are components of blood that are given to a patient by transfusion. They include:red blood cellsplateletsplasmaantibodiesBlood products are produced from blood from blood donors.Blood products can then be given to patients depending on their needs. Patients rarely receive transfusions of whole blood in modern medicine.Blood products are screened for:infectious agents such as HIVtheir blood groupthe presence of certain antibodiesBlood for transfusion must be compatible with that of the patient's blood, for instance, their blood group. Before a transfusion, white blood cells are often removed to reduce the risk of infections or immune reactions.Looking at blood cellsYou may be given some prepared slides of blood to examine with a microscope.Many types of blood cell are 10 μm in size or less. You will need high power to examine them.The slides will have been stained to show the cells and cell features. The micrograph shows many red blood cells and three white blood cells.An example of a commonly-used stain is Giemsa stain. It aids identification by staining:red blood cells pinkplatelets pale pinkwhite blood cell cytoplasm pale bluewhite blood cell nuclei magenta",Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Exchange surfaces and transport systems
57,Molecules of life,"Carbohydrates, proteins and lipids (or fats) are major nutrients that we need in large quantities.We get these by eating them. They are broken down first and then reassembled into our own carbohydrates, proteins and lipids.This is because:most of the molecules in food are too large to pass through the absorbing surface of the gut wallthe carbohydrates, proteins and lipids are reassembled in the form required, rather than other animal or plant versionsNutrientMajor functionMajor sourcesCarbohydratesSource of energy, glucose is the main respiratory substrateStarch - potatoes, rice and wheat products, bread, cereals and pasta; sugars - fruit, smoothies, fizzy drinks, chocolate and sweetsProteinsGrowth and repairMeat, eggs, cheese, beans, nuts and seedsLipidsEnergy, make up part of cell membranes so essential for normal growthButter and margarine, meat and processed meat, plant oils, oily fish, nuts and seedsCarbohydratesCarbohydrates in our diet include sugars and starches.The glucose molecule is small enough to be absorbed directly through the walls of the digestive system. It is essential for respiration.Starch is a carbohydrate made from a long chain of glucose molecules. So, starch is a polymer of glucose. It must be broken down into glucose molecules _ it is too large to pass through the gut wall.Cellulose is also made up of glucose molecules. It makes up plant cell walls so it is  a fundamental part of our diet. It cannot be broken down by the digestive system, so it is egested from the gut.Once absorbed by the body, glucose molecules are transported to cells and:used for respirationreassembled into the storage form of carbohydrate in animals - glycogenIn plant metabolism, the glucose produced by photosynthesis is converted into starch for storage, and cellulose for cell wall synthesis.curriculum-key-factIn humans, other animals and fungi, glucose is stored in glycogen. It is not converted into starch.ProteinsProteins are made up of amino acids folded into the correct shape.Proteins are big molecules that are too large to pass through the gut wall. They must first be broken down into amino acids.Once inside the body, the amino acids are reassembled into the proteins the individual requires _ the process of protein synthesis.Excess amino acids are broken down in the liver.LipidsLipids are esters of fatty acids and glycerol.In a lipid, there may be 1, 2 or 3 fatty acids combined with glycerol. Fatty acids 1, 2 and 3 may be the same, or differentLipid molecules are too large to pass through the gut wall and must be digested first.In the body's cells, they are reassembled into the lipids the cell needs, for instance, for the cell membranes.Lipids are a store of energy because cells can break them down and use them in respiration.",The digestive system,The digestive system,The digestive system,The digestive system

Then all the digested lipids pass through a duct into the bloodstream.",The digestive system,The digestive system,The digestive system,Transport over larger distances
59,Enzymes,"Most of the food we eat is complex carbohydrates, proteins and lipids. These must be broken down to be absorbed into the body.The chemical reactions required to break them down would be too slow without enzymes.Enzymes are biological catalysts _ they speed up chemical reactions.Enzymes are required for most of the chemical reactions that occur in organisms. These reactions occur in the breakdown of chemical molecules, which we see in the digestive system.Enzymes are also involved in the building up of chemical molecules elsewhere in the body.Enzymes are proteins that have a complex 3D shape. Each enzyme has a region called an active site.The substrate _ the molecule or molecules taking part in the chemical reaction _ fits into the active site. Once bound to the active site, the chemical reaction takes place .In an organism, the active site of each enzyme is a different shape. It is a perfect match to the shape of the substrate molecule, or molecules. This is essential to the enzyme being able to work. One enzyme is therefore specific to one substrate's chemical reaction, or type of chemical reaction.This theory for the way in which enzymes work is called the lock and key theory.Factors affecting enzyme actionPhysical factors affect enzyme activity.TemperatureAt low temperatures, the number of successful collisions between the enzyme and substrate is reduced because their molecular movement decreases. The reaction is slow.The human body is maintained at 37°C as this is the temperature at which the enzymes in our body work best. This is not true of the enzymes in all organisms.Higher temperatures disrupt the shape of the active site, which will reduce its activity, or prevent it from working. The enzyme will have been denatured.Enzymes therefore work best at a particular temperature.Enzyme actionProteins are chains of amino acids joined end to end. This chain is not straight _ it twists and folds as different amino acids in the chain are attracted to, or repel each other.Each enzyme is made from proteins made of these twisting and folding amino acids, and therefore the enzyme has a unique shape. This structure is held together by weak forces between the amino acid molecules in the chain.High temperatures will break these forces. The enzyme, including its active site, will change shape and the substrate will no longer fit. The rate of reaction will be affected, or the reaction will stop.A graph showing the effect of temperature on enzyme activityThe effect of pHEnzymes are also sensitive to pH. Changing the pH of its surroundings will also change the shape of the active site of an enzyme.Many amino acids in an enzyme molecule carry a charge. Within the enzyme molecule, positively and negatively charged amino acids will attract each other. This contributes to the folding of the enzyme molecule, its shape, and the shape of the active site.Changing the pH will affect the charges on the amino acid molecules. Amino acids that attracted each other may no longer attract each other. Again, the shape of the enzyme, along with its active site, will change.Extremes of pH also denature enzymes. The changes are usually permanent.Enzymes work inside and outside cells, for instance in the digestive system where cell pH is kept at 7.0 to 7.4. Cellular enzymes will work best within this pH range.Different parts of the digestive system produce different enzymes. These have different optimum pHs.The optimum pH in the stomach is produced by the secretion of hydrochloric acid.The optimum pH in the duodenum is produced by the secretion of sodium hydrogencarbonate.The following table gives examples of how some of the enzymes in the digestive system have different optimum pHs:EnzymeOptimum pHSalivary amylase6.8Stomach protease (pepsin)1.5 - 2.0Pancreatic protease (trypsin)7.5 - 8.0A graph showing the effect of pH on enzyme activityQuestionSuggest an enzyme that would produce a trend as shown in the graph above.Reveal answerupdownPancreatic protease (trypsin).",The digestive system,The digestive system,The digestive system,"Energy, rates and reactions"

61,Required practical - food tests,"Qualitative tests for foodsThere are several qualitative tests for food chemicals. These can be used to detect the presence of food chemicals, but not how much is present (which would be a quantitative analysis).Test for sugarsBenedict's test is used to detect sugars.MethodHeat in a water bathResultAfter heating, it may go through stages - green, yellow, orange, red or brown - depending on how much glucose is present  Sugars classed as reducing sugars will react with Benedict's solution on heating for a few minutes. Glucose is an example of a reducing sugar.Reducing sugars give a red-brown precipitate with Benedict's solution. The precipitate takes a while to settle in the tube _ you're more likely to see simply a red or brown colour. If there's not much glucose present, the final colour may be green or yellow, or orange if there's a little more.HazardsWear safety goggles.Benedict's solution is an irritant.Avoid contact with skin and eyes.Test for starchAdd iodine solution to the food being tested.Foods containing starch will turn a blue-black colour.The iodine test can also be used with a microscope to stain starch grains in plant cells.HazardsWear safety goggles.Iodine solution is an irritant.Avoid contact with skin and eyes.Test for proteinsThe biuret test is used to detect proteins.Biuret reagent is sometimes available as a single solution.MethodAdd 1 cm3 of biuret solution A to the food solution.Mix the liquids.Add 1 cm3 of biuret solution B and shake OR add 1 cm3 of biuret solution B carefully down the side of the test tube so as to form two layers.ResultsHazardsWear safety goggles.Biuret solution A is corrosive.Biuret solution B is an irritant.Avoid contact with skin and eyes.Test for fatsThe Sudan III testThe Sudan III test is one test used to test for lipids.MethodResultsIf lipid is present in the sample, it stains red.HazardsWear safety goggles.Sudan III solution is flammable as it is dissolved in alcohol.Avoid contact with skin and eyes.The emulsion testThe emulsion test is an alternative test for lipids.HazardsWear safety goggles.Ethanol is flammable.Avoid contact with skin and eyes.",The digestive system,Calculations in chemistry,Transport into and out of cells,Transport over larger distances
62,Neurones,"The human nervous system consists of:the central nervous system (CNS) - the brain and spinal cordthe peripheral nervous system - nerve cells that carry information to or from the CNSThe nervous system allows us to react to our surroundings and coordinate our behaviour.The conditions inside our body must be carefully controlled if the body is to function effectively. The conditions are controlled in two ways with chemical and nervous responses.All control systems include:Cells called receptors, which detect stimuli (changes in the environment).The coordination centre, such as the brain, spinal cord or a gland such as the pancreas, which receives and processes information from receptors around the body.Effectors bring about responses, which restore optimum levels, such as core body temperature and blood glucose levels. Effectors include muscles and glands, and so responses can include muscle contractions or hormone release.Nerve cellsNerve cells are called neurones. They are adapted to carry electrical impulses from one part of the body to another.A bundle of neurones is called a nerve.There are three main types of neurone:sensory neuronesrelay neuronesmotor neuronesThey have some features in common:the cell body that contains the nucleus, organelles and most of the cytoplasm of the neuroneone or more dendrons, which carry nerve impulses towards the cell body, and an axon, a single fibre that carries nerve impulses away from the cell bodya fatty, myelin sheath, that covers and insulates the neuroneA motor neuroneSensory neurones carry electrical signals - nerve impulses - towards the central nervous system (spinal cord and brain). The signal starts in a receptor which detects a change. Relay neurones carry nerve impulses within the central nervous system. Motor neurones carry nerve impulses away from the central nervous system. The neurone ends in either a muscle or gland, which are effectors.Receptors to effectorsThe flow chart summarises how information flows from receptors to effectors in a coordination system.Stimulus _ receptor _ coordinator _ effector _ responseThe diagram summarises how information flows from receptors to effectors in the nervous system.SynapsesNeurones do not connect physically with one another. Where neurones meet, there is a small gap called a  synapse.When a nerve impulse travels from one neurone to another:an electrical impulse travels along the first neurone.when it reaches the end of the neurone, chemical transmitter molecules called neurotransmitters are releasedthe neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse and bind with receptor molecules on the membrane of the second neuronethis stimulates the second neurone to transmit the electrical impulse",Coordination and control,Coordination and control,Coordination and control,Coordination and control
63,Reflex actions,"A reflex action is an automatic and rapid response to a stimulus - we do not have to think about a response. Reflex actions minimise damage to the body from potentially harmful conditions, such as touching something hot.Different types of neurones work together in a reflex action. A reflex action follows this general sequence:The nerve pathway followed by a reflex action is called a reflex arc.A simple reflex action happens if we accidentally touch something hot. We rapidly move our hand away. This is called the pain withdrawal reflex.The diagram shows the reflex arc involved.The receptor in the skin detects a stimulus - the change in temperature.The sensory neurone sends nerve impulses to the spinal cord.The relay neurone, which is located in the spinal cord, carries the nerve impulses from sensory neurones to motor neurones.The motor neurone sends nerve impulses to the effector.The effector - the biceps muscle in the arm - contracts so that the hand is moved away.",Coordination and control,Combined Science,Coordination and control,Coordination and control

65,Hormones and glands,"A hormone is a chemical messenger.Hormones are produced by endocrine glands and carried in the bloodstream. They alter the activity of specific target organs.One  example of this is the hormone adrenaline, which is released by the adrenal gland. One of its target organs is the heart, where it increases the heart rate. Once a hormone has been used, and its action complete, it is destroyed by the liver.The effects of hormones on the body are almost always much slower than the nervous system, but they last for longer.Contraceptive pills contain hormones to reduce the chances of becoming pregnantThere are important differences between nervous and hormonal control.NervousHormonalType of signalElectrical (chemical at synapses)ChemicalTransmission of signalBy nerve cells (neurones)By the bloodstreamEffectorsMuscles or glandsTarget cells in particular tissuesSpeed of responseVery rapidSlowerDuration of responseShort (until nerve impulses stop)Long (until hormone is broken down)Master glandThe pituitary gland, at the base of the brain, is known as a 'master gland'. It secretes several hormones that can act on other glands to stimulate the release of other types of hormone.The endocrine systemThe endocrine system produces a range of different  hormones that travel in the bloodstream and affect a number of different organs or cells in the body. The diagram shows the location of some of these glands.",Coordination and control,Coordination and control,Coordination and control,Coordination and control
66,Negative feedback - Higher,"In mammals, conditions such as water concentration, temperature and glucose concentration must be kept as constant as possible. These are examples of homeostasis.A negative feedback mechanism is an important type of control that is used in homeostasis. A negative feedback control system responds when conditions change from the ideal or set point and returns conditions to this set point. There is a continuous cycle of events in negative feedback.General stages in negative feedbackIn general:if the level of something rises, control systems reduce it againif the level of something falls, control systems raise it againNegative feedback flowchartAn example of negative feedback is the control of body temperature.If the body gets too hot, it begins to sweat to try to reduce the temperature. If the body gets too cold, it begins to shiver to try to raise the temperature.The glucose concentration in the blood is also controlled by negative feedback mechanisms.",Coordination and control,Combined Science,Homeostasis,Homeostasis
67,Thyroxine and adrenaline - Higher,"ThyroxineThyroxine is produced from the thyroid gland. Thyroxine stimulates the basal metabolic rate - the speed at which oxygen and food products react to release energy for the body to use, and other chemical reactions that occur in the body.Thyroxine also plays an important role in growth and development.Thyroxine levels are controlled by negative feedback.Negative feedback mechanism that controls the secretion of thyroxineThe pituitary gland has an important role in detecting and controlling thyroxine levels.High thyroxine levels in the bloodstream prevent the release of TSH from the pituitary gland, so normal blood levels are restored.Low thyroxine levels in the bloodstream stimulate the pituitary gland to release TSH so the thyroid releases more thyroxine. So, blood levels return to normal.AdrenalineAdrenaline is produced by the adrenal glands in times of fear or stress.Adrenaline  increases the heart rate, boosting the delivery of oxygen and glucose to the brain and muscles, preparing the body for 'fight or flight'.When adrenaline is released into the bloodstream it has multiple effects:it increases breathing rate, heart rate, blood flow to the brain and muscles and conversion of glycogen to glucose so more energy can be released in the musclesas we have only a set volume of blood in our bodies, it diverts blood away from areas such as the digestive system and skin towards the muscles - this is why people go pale when they have a frightThe effects of adrenaline allow the body to prepare for action in situations where a quick response may be essential.",Coordination and control,Coordination and control,Homeostasis,Transport over larger distances
68,Plant tissues,"Meristems are found at the tips of roots and shoots. Here, unspecialised stem cells undergo a type of cell division called mitosis. This does not occur in other parts of the plants. In all other parts of plants, cells can only become bigger in a process called cell elongation.Cells produced by mitosis in meristems help plants continue to grow in height and width throughout their life. Animals do not have meristems, so they stop growing in size once they become adults.Plant meristems divide to produce cells that increase the height of plants, the length of roots and the girth of the stem. They also produce cells that develop into leaves and flowers. So they can differentiate into specialised cell types depending on where they are in the plant.Roots forming from a plant meristemPlant structuresAs  multicellular plants, like multicellular animals, increase in size, their smaller surface to volume ratio becomes smaller. Because of this, they have evolved tissues, organs and organ systems. As in animals, these are specialised.Together, the roots, stem and leaves form a plant organ system for transporting and exchanging substances around the plant.Plants take in water from the soil, along with dissolved ions such as nitrate - which they use to make proteins -  and magnesium - which they use to make chlorophyll. These are transported in the roots, stem and leaves.Any part of a plant above ground, where it is exposed to light, can photosynthesise. But a plant's leaves are the main organ of photosynthesis.Plant leaves are adapted for gas exchange and photosynthesis.FeatureFunctionLarge surface areaFor maximum absorption of light; for optimum absorption of carbon dioxideA thin, flattened blade - though there are exceptionsSo that water and gases have a limited distance to diffuseVascular tissue in the midrib and veinsBranches of the xylem, to transport water and minerals to the leaf; branches of the phloem, to transport glucose and other products of photosynthesis to other parts of the plantAir spaces between cells within the leafFor the diffusion of gasesThe structure of a leafPlant leaves are adapted for photosynthesis, and the exchange of gases required for the process. The structure of the tissues is related to their functions in the plant.Absorbing light energyThe palisade mesophyll layer of the leaf is adapted to absorb light efficiently. The cells:are packed with many chloroplastsare column-shaped and arranged closely togethertowards the upper surface of the leafGas exchangeSpongy mesophyll tissue is packed loosely for efficient gas exchange. The spongy mesophyll cells are covered by a thin layer of water. Gases dissolve in this water as they move into and out of the cells.When the plant is photosynthesising during the day, these features allow carbon dioxide to diffuse into the spongy mesophyll cells, and oxygen to diffuse out of them.To enter the leaf, gases diffuse through small pores called stomata. As the stomata open, water is lost by the process of transpiration. Closing the stomata helps to control water.",Plant organisation,States of matter,Plant organisation,Transport over larger distances
69,Transpiration,"When the plant opens its stomata to let in carbon dioxide, water on the surface of the cells of the spongy mesophyll and palisade mesophyll evaporates and diffuses out of the leaf. This process is called transpiration.Water is drawn from the cells in the xylem to replace that which has been lost from the leaves.XylemThe xylem transports water and minerals from the roots up the plant stem and into the leaves.In a mature flowering plant or tree, most of the cells that make up the xylem are specialised cells called vessels.VesselsLose their end walls so the xylem forms a continuous, hollow tube.Become strengthened by a chemical called lignin. The cells are no longer alive. Lignin gives strength and support to the plant. We call lignified cells wood.Transport in the xylem is a physical process. It does not require energy.Water molecules inside the xylem cells are strongly attracted to each other. There is strong cohesion between the molecules because of hydrogen bonding. A continuous column of water is therefore pulled up the stem in the transpiration stream by evaporation from the leaves.As water travels through the xylem in the stem and leaf, it is being replaced by water taken up by the roots.Transpiration is an unavoidable consequence of photosynthesis - only about 5% of the water taken up by the plant is used for photosynthesis - but transpiration does have its purposes as it:provides the water for photosynthesistransports mineral ionscools the leaf as water evaporatesprovides water that keeps the cells turgid, which supports herbaceous plantsWater uptake and transport across the rootRoot hairs are single-celled extensions of epidermal cells in the root. They grow between soil particles and absorb water and minerals from the soil.Water enters the root hair cells by osmosis. This happens because soil water has a higher water potential than the cytoplasm of the root hair cell. Minerals enter by active transport.Soil water moves into the root hair cell by osmosis and across the root cortex to the xylemA summary of water uptake, water transport and transpiration:",Plant organisation,Plant organisation,Plant organisation,Plant organisation

These include:temperaturehumidityair movementlight intensityThe table below explains how factors increase the rate of transpiration:FactorChange in factor that increases transpiration rateExplanationTemperatureIncreaseIncreases molecular movement so that more water molecules evaporate from cell surfaces and the rate of diffusion of water molecules from the leaf is increased

71,Investigating transpiration - counting stomata,"Counting stomataScientists use sampling and counting techniques to investigate the distribution of stomata on leaves. They count stomata to investigate:their numbers, density and distribution on upper and lower surfacesnumbers that are open and closed at any timeadaptations of plants to environmental conditions, eg desert and water plantseffects of changing conditions such as increased carbon dioxide concentrations from climate changeBelow are two methods with which stomata can be counted.Method 1Put a small drop of water on a microscope slide.Hold the leaf with the surface you want to examine uppermost.Tear the leaf obliquely (in a slanted way) so  as to reveal part of the epidermis.Place the torn-off part of the leaf on the microscope slide and examine.Method 2Paint the surface of the leaf with clear nail varnish.Allow to dry.Peel off the nail varnish with forceps.Place the nail varnish _ which will have an impression of the leaf surface _ on a dry microscope slide and examine.Recording the distributionThe density of stomata on a leaf is recorded per unit area, usually the number per square mm. A microscope is calibrated so that its field of view is known.Calculating the areaIn the illustration, the diameter of the field of view of the microscope is 0.40 mm.Its area can be calculated using formula _r2Where 	_:= 3.14 and r = radius of the field of view
If the diameter of the field of view is 0.40 mm, the radius is 0.20 mm.Area = _r2 = 3.14 _ 0.20 _ 0.20 = 0.13 mm2The number of stomata in the field of view is 12.The area of the field of view is 0.13 mm2Therefore, based on this single count, the density of stomata over 1 mm2 is:\[12\;\times\; \frac{1.00}{0.13}\; =\: 92\: stomata\]The density of stomata is therefore 92 stomata per mm2.

72,Investigating transpiration - measuring the water uptake of a plant,"Investigating transpirationThe uptake of water can be measured using a potometer. Under normal circumstances, the rate of water uptake gives a measure of the rate of transpiration.A simple potometer is a piece of capillary tubing to which a plant has been connected.

74,Translocation,"During photosynthesis, plants produce glucose from simple inorganic molecules - carbon dioxide and water - using light energy. Some of the glucose produced by photosynthesis is used for respiration. This releases energy for the seven life processes.Translocation is the movement of sugar produced in photosynthesis to all other parts of the plant for respiration and the other processes described above. This occurs in phloem cells. PhloemThe phloem moves food substances that the plant has produced by photosynthesis to where they are needed for processes such as:growing parts of the plant for immediate usestorage organs such as bulbs and tubersdeveloping seedsTransport in the phloem therefore takes place both up and down the stem - in contrast to transport in the xylem, which is just upwards.Transport of substances in the phloem is called translocation.Phloem consists of living cells. The cells that make up the phloem are adapted to their function:Sieve tubes - specialised for transport and have no nuclei. Each sieve tube has a perforated end so its cytoplasm connects one cell to the next.Companion cells - transport of substances in the phloem requires energy. One or more companion cells attached to each sieve tube provide this energy. A sieve tube is completely dependent on its companion cell(s).Comparison of transport in the xylem and phloemXylemPhloemType of transportPhysical processRequires energySubstances transportedWater and mineralsProducts of photosynthesis; includes sugars and amino acids dissolved in waterDirection of transportUpwardsUpwards and downwardsThe xylem and phloem are distributed differently in roots and stems. In the root, the xylem forms a central column. It forms a solid support. The phloem is towards the centre, outside the xylem.In the stem, the transport tissues of the xylem and phloem are grouped into vascular bundles.",Plant organisation,Respiration,Plant organisation,Transport over larger distances
75,The process of photosynthesis,"Plants, unlike animals, can make their own food. They do this using a process called photosynthesis. The food that plants produce is important, not only for the plants themselves, but for the other organisms that feed on the plants. Getting optimum rates of photosynthesis produces maximum plant yields.Greg Foot explains the effect of temperature, light intensity and carbon dioxide concentration on the rate of photosynthesisDuring photosynthesis, plants produce glucose from simple inorganic molecules _ carbon dioxide and water _ using light energy.The word and symbol equations for photosynthesis are:curriculum-key-factBe careful not to confuse this photosynthesis equation with respiration which is the reverse of this. The balanced symbol equation shown above is Higher tier only.Photosynthesis requires energy in the form of light to drive the chemical reaction. Photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction.The light energy required is absorbed by a green pigment called chlorophyll in the leaves. Chlorophyll is located in chloroplasts in plant cells, particularly the palisade and spongy mesophyll cells. Revise plant cells and their part in photosythesis here.Plant leaves are the main photosynthetic organ, but any part of the plant exposed to the light will develop chlorophyll and photosynthesise.The carbon dioxide required for photosynthesis comes from the air. It enters leaves through the stomata. Water enters the plant through the roots, and is transported to the leaves in the xylem.Oxygen is formed as the waste product. Some is used for the plant's respiration, and also released, which makes it available for respiration to animals and many microorganisms. During the day, provided the rate of photosynthesis is sufficiently high, plant leaves and water plants give out oxygen.BiosynthesisSome of the glucose produced by photosynthesis is used for respiration.Glucose is also the starting point for the biosynthesis of materials that plants need to live.The glucose not used for respiration is used in the following ways:There are four major uses of glucose produced in photosynthesis:Many glucose molecules are joined together to form insoluble starch. This is a storage product of glucose in plants.Many glucose molecules are joined together to form insoluble cellulose. This is used to build cell walls for new growth.Glucose is joined with nitrates absorbed from the soil to make amino acids. These are joined together to make proteins during protein synthesis.Glucose is also converted to lipids, which is often stored  in seeds.",Photosynthesis,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Plant organisation,Photosynthesis
76,Chlorophyll,Chlorophyll absorbs the light energy required to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose. It is found within chloroplasts  in cells exposed to light.Chlorophyll is green - so absorbs the red and blue parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and reflects the green part of the spectrum.Leaves with more chlorophyll are better able to absorb the light required for photosynthesis.,Photosynthesis,Plant organisation,Photosynthesis,Photosynthesis

The paper has absorbed the solvent, and the dye has spread further up the paperPhasesChromatography relies on two different 'phases':the stationary phase, which in paper chromatography is absorbent paperthe mobile phase is the solvent that moves through the stationary phase - in this instance, the paper - carrying different substances with itThe different dissolved substances in a mixture are attracted to the two phases to different degrees. This causes them to move at different rates through the paper.Interpreting a chromatogramSeparation by chromatography produces a chromatogram. A paper chromatogram can be used to distinguish between pure and impure substances:a pure substance produces one spot on the chromatograman impure substance produces two or more spotsA paper chromatogram can also be used to identify substances by comparing them with known substances. Two substances are likely to be the same if:they produce the same number of spots, and these match in colourthe spots travel the same distance up the paper (have the same Rf value)Interpreting the chromatogram for a brown inkIn this chromatogram, the brown ink is made of a mixture of the red, blue and yellow inks. This is because the spots in the brown ink reach the same heights (and have the same Rf value) as the reference inks.Rf valuesRf values can be used to identify unknown chemicals if they can be compared to a range of reference substances. The Rf value is always the same for a particular substance if run in the same solvent system in the same conditions.The Rf value of a spot is calculated using:Rf = \(\frac{\textup{distance~travelled~by~substance}}{\textup{distance~travelled~by~solvent}}\)Rf values vary from 0 (the substance is not attracted at all to the mobile phase) to 1 (the substance is not attracted to the stationary phase).Measurements needed to calculate an Rf valueDifferent compounds have different Rf values in different solvents, which can be used to identify them.

They also contain several other types of pigment that capture light falling on leaves.Mixtures of these pigments from chloroplasts can be separated using paper chromatography.The pigments can be extracted from leaves by grinding the leaves in organic solvents with a pinch of sand to break up the plant cells.The pigments can be separated using a mixture of organic solvents.A chromatogram showing the photosynthetic pigments of a grass",Photosynthesis,Transport into and out of cells,Photosynthesis,Photosynthesis
79,Factors affecting photosynthesis,"There are several ways of measuring the rate of photosynthesis in the lab. These include:the rate of oxygen outputthe rate of carbon dioxide uptakethe rate of carbohydrate productionThese are not perfect methods as the plant will also be respiring, which will use up some oxygen and carbohydrate and increase carbon dioxide output.Several factors can affect the rate of photosynthesis:light intensitycarbon dioxide concentrationtemperatureThe amount of chlorophyll also affects the rate of photosynthesis:plants growing in darker areas synthesise more chlorophyll, to absorb the light requiredthe effects of some plant diseases affect the amount of chlorophyll, and therefore the ability of a plant to photosynthesiseLight intensityWithout enough light, a plant cannot photosynthesise very quickly - even if there is plenty of water and carbon dioxide and a suitable temperature.Increasing the light intensity increases the rate of photosynthesis, until some other factor - a limiting factor _ becomes in short supply.previousnextpreviousnext1.previousnext2.previousnext3.At very high light intensities, photosynthesis is slowed and then inhibited, but these light intensities do not occur in nature.Carbon dioxide concentrationCarbon dioxide - with water - is one of the reactants in photosynthesis.If the concentration of carbon dioxide is increased, the rate of photosynthesis will therefore increase.Again, at some point, a factor may become limiting.TemperatureThe chemical reactions that combine carbon dioxide and water to produce glucose are controlled by enzymes. As with any other enzyme-controlled reaction, the rate of photosynthesis is affected by temperature.At low temperatures, the rate of photosynthesis is limited by the number of molecular collisions between enzymes and substrates. At high temperatures, enzymes are denatured.ChlorophyllChlorophyll is the green pigment found in chloroplasts which absorbs light energy for photosynthesis.Leaves that are growing in darker conditions usually have more chlorophyll. They receive less light so they require more chlorophyll to increase their rate of photosynthesis.The compensation pointThese graphs have been plotted with rate of photosynthesis against the factor under investigation.If oxygen production or carbon dioxide uptake is used as a measure of photosynthetic rate, the graphs are slightly different. The line does not go through the origin.This is because oxygen production and carbon dioxide uptake are affected by respiration as well as photosynthesis. For instance, if a graph is plotted of carbon dioxide against light intensity:The compensation point is the light intensity at which the rate of photosynthesis is equal to the rate of respiration.A similar graph will be obtained if oxygen production is plotted against light intensity.",Photosynthesis,Photosynthesis,Photosynthesis,Photosynthesis
80,Required practical - effect of light intensity on photosynthesis,"The effect of light intensity on the photosynthesis rate using an aquatic organismThe effect of light intensity on photosynthesis can be investigated in water plants. Use Cabomba or Elodea, which are sold in aquarium shops.The plants will release bubbles of oxygen - a product of photosynthesis - which can be counted.A lamp with an LED bulb is set up at different distances from the plant in a beaker of water:an LED bulb is best as this will not raise the temperature of the watersodium hydrogencarbonate - formula NaHCO3 -  is added to the water to supply carbon dioxide - a reactant in photosynthesis - to the plantthe light intensity is proportional to distance - it will decrease as the distance away from the bulb increases - so light intensity for the investigation can be varied by changing the distance from the lamp to the plantThe bubbles produced over one minute periods are recorded.AimTo investigate the effect of light intensity on the rate of photosynthesis.MethodSet up a boiling tube containing 45 cm3 of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution (1%). Allow the tube to stand for a few minutes and shake to disperse any air bubbles that might form.Cut a piece of the pondweed, Cabomba. The pondweed should be 8 cm long.Use forceps to place the pondweed in the boiling tube carefully, with the cut end uppermost. Make sure that you don't damage the pondweed, or cause the liquid to overflow.Position the boiling tube so that the pondweed is 10 cm away from the light source.Allow the boiling tube to stand for five minutes.Count the number of bubbles emerging from the cut end of the stems in one minute.Repeat the count five times and record your results.Calculate the average number of bubbles produced per minute.Repeat the experiment at different distances away from the light source.VariablesIndependent variable - distance from the light source/light intensity.Dependent variable - the number of bubbles produced per minute.Control variables - concentration of sodium hydrogencarbonate solution, temperature, using the same piece of Cabomba pondweed each time.RisksCare must be taken when using water near electrical equipment. Ensure that your hands are dry when handling the lamp.Extension activitiesThe volume of oxygen produced could be measured by collecting the gas produced in a gas syringe.The changes in the oxygen concentration in the water could be measured using data logging equipment.You could investigate the effect of different wavelengths of light on photosynthesis.Use coloured acetate filters to investigate the effects of the blue, green and red parts of the spectrum on photosynthesis.ResultsThe table shows a set of results obtained by students investigating the effect of light intensity on photosynthesis.

81,The inverse square law - Higher,"There is an inverse relationship between distance and light intensity - as the distance increases, light intensity decreases.This is because as the distance away from a light source increases, photons of light become spread over a wider area.The relationship is not linear.The light energy at twice the distance away is spread over four times the area.The light energy at three times the distance away is spread over nine times the area, and so on.curriculum-key-fact The light intensity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance - this is the inverse square law.For each distance of the plant from the lamp, light intensity will be proportional to the inverse of \(d^{2}\), \(d^{2}\) meaning distance squared.Calculating \(\frac{1}{d^{2}}\):For instance, for the lamp 10 cm away from the plant:\[\frac{1}{d^{2}} = \frac{1}{10^{2}} = \frac{1}{100} = 0.01\]If we refer back to the data the students collected from the experiment:DistanceRate10 cm12015 cm5420 cm3025 cm1730 cm13Completing the results table:Distance\[\frac{1}{d^{2}}\]Rate10 cm0.010012015 cm0.00445420 cm0.00253025 cm0.00161730 cm0.001113If we plot a graph of the rate of reaction over \(\frac{1}{d^{2}}\):This graph is linear.The relationship between light intensity - at these low light intensities - is linear.Be careful - the x-axis is values of \(\frac{1}{d^{2}}\). It is not of light intensity.\(\frac{1}{d^{2}}\) is proportional to light intensity.",Photosynthesis,Motion,Waves,Movement and interactions
82,Limiting factors affecting the rate of photosynthesis - HigherWater,"In the UK, water is often the main limiting factor for photosynthesis.You won't see graphs for its effects, as water is important in many other areas of a plant's life, and not just photosynthesis. Most important is its role as a solvent for all the chemical reactions in cells.LightLight intensity affects the rate of photosynthesis. The light intensity fluctuates during the day, and will also be affected by the weather. The rate of photosynthesis will change with the time of day.The rate of photosynthesis will also change during the year in countries like the UK.Carbon dioxideLevels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere are rising because of greenhouse gas emissions. They are currently at around 0.04%. This concentration is still very low in terms of being the optimum for photosynthesis.Carbon dioxide concentration is therefore an important limiting factor for photosynthesis.TemperaturePlants can photosynthesise over a wide range of temperatures from 0°C to around 50°C.The optimum temperature for most plants is 15°C to around 40°C.Temperature affects the rate of photosynthesis in crop plants and affects where certain crops can be grown.The table is an example of the optimum and maximum temperatures for the growth of some crops:CropOptimumMaximumMinimumMaize22 - 25°C34°C20°CPotato15 - 20°C34°C12°CRice30 - 33°C40°C18°CSoya beans25 - 28°C40°C10°CWheat20 - 25°C38°C5°CMost scientists think that with rising temperatures, crop production will be negatively affected by climate change.ChlorophyllPlants grown in shady places increase the chlorophyll content of their leaves so that they can absorb the necessary light energy required for photosynthesis.The position of the compensation point is different from plants grown in brighter conditions.For shade-adapted plants, the compensation point is lower - their rate of photosynthesis will exceed the rate of respiration at lower light intensities than the plants adapted to sun.",Photosynthesis,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,States of matter,Photosynthesis
83,Plant diseases - viruses and fungi,"A pathogen is an organism that causes a disease. There are four types of pathogen that cause diseases in plants:fungivirusesprotistsbacteriaDiseases caused by pathogens are called communicable diseases. This means they can be caught. The spread of communicable diseases is called transmission.Plant pathogens infect a host, reproduce inside the host - or replicate themselves in the case of a virus - then spread from their host to infect other individuals.Plant pathogens kill or reduce the growth of many plants. Plant pathogens of food crops usually reduce crop yields and can be especially serious.VirusesThe pattern produced by tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) in a tobacco leaf (Nicotiana tabacum)The tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infects tobacco plants and other closely related species, such as tomatoes and peppers.TMV is transmitted by contact between plants, either naturally or on the hands of farmers or contaminated clothes or tools.TMV infects the chloroplasts of plant leaves and reduces the plant's ability to photosynthesise. The leaves change colour from green to yellow or white and develop a mosaic pattern. It can also make leaves crinkled or curled up. This and the reduction in photosynthesis means that the plant will not grow properly, and will reduce farmers' crop yields.FungiRose black spot fungus causes black and purple spots on leavesRose black spot is caused by a fungus which infects roses. It infects leaves and causes black or purple spots on the leaves. The rest of the leaves often turn yellow and drop off the plant. This reduces the plant's ability to photosynthesise and therefore reduces growth.Rose black spot is spread by the spores of the fungus that are produced in the black spots.The spores can be transmitted in air or water - blown by the wind or in raindrops - as well as being transferred from plant to plant by gardeners.",Plant diseases,Plant diseases,Plant diseases,Plant diseases
84,Controlling the spread of plant disease,"Plant pathogens cause diseases with a range of different symptoms. These symptoms can be used to identify the pathogen and then treat the disease, or limit its effects. The symptoms of rose black spot and the tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) are shown below.previousnextpreviousnextSymptom and example of diseaseSpots on leaves caused by the rose black spot funguspreviousnextSymptom and example of diseaseDiscoloration caused by the tobacco mosaic virusControlling the spread of tobacco mosaic virusTo control the spread of TMV, farmers must:dig up and destroy infected plantswash their hands after handling infected plantswash tools that have come into contact with infected plants in detergent or bleachrotate the crops they grow in a contaminated field - they must not grow tobacco or tomato plants in the field for at least two yearsPlant scientists have now also produced varieties of crops - by selective breeding  and genetic engineering - that are resistant to TMV.Controlling and treating rose black spotBlack spot is treatable using fungicides. The fungicide can also be sprayed on rose bushes to prevent infection, especially when the weather is likely to be warm and wet. Transmission can be reduced by:not planting rose bushes too close together, which allows air to circulate around the plantsavoiding wetting the leaves when watering the plantcollecting and destroying infected leavesMany rose growers also now grow resistant varieties of roses.",Plant diseases,Combined Science,Plant diseases,Plant diseases
85,Health and disease,"Health is the state of physical, mental and social well-being. It is not just being free from disease.Factors can work together to affect physical and mental health. Diseases stop part of the body from working properly. A disease is a disorder that affects an organism's body, organs, tissues or cells.Diseases can be grouped into two types:communicable, which are caused by pathogens and can be transferred from one person to another, or from one organism to another, eg in humans, these include measles, food poisoning and malarianon-communicable, which are not transferred between people or other organismsNon-communicable diseases include:cancerdiabetesgenetic diseases and conditionsheart diseaseneurological disordersNon-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes, are the leading causes of death in the world.Other factors that can have major effects on physical and mental health include:dietlifestyle factors such as alcohol and other drugsstresssituations that may occur in a person's life",Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Interactions with the environment
86,Pathogens and their transmission,"A pathogen is a microorganism that causes a disease. There are three main types of pathogen:PathogenExample in animalsExample in plantsVirusesHIV potentially leading to AIDSTobacco mosaic virusBacteriaSalmonellaAgrobacteriumFungiAthlete's footRose black spotPathogens infect a host, reproduce themselves, or replicate if it is a virus, spread from their host and infect other organisms.Diseases caused by pathogens are called communicable diseases.  This means they can be transferred from one individual to another.The spread of communicable diseaseTransmission can occur in a number of important ways, as shown in the table below:TypeExamplesDirect contactThis can be through contact with other people, eg by shaking hands, or contact with surfaces that other people have touched. The common cold can be transmitted in this way.
Pathogens can also be spread through sexual contact, eg the bacterium that causes gonorrhoea.WaterThrough  water that is contaminated with microorganisms, such as the cholera bacterium.AirThrough the air when people cough or sneeze. When a person who is infected by the common cold, influenza (flu) or measles, sneezes, they can spray thousands of tiny droplets containing virus particles to infect others.Contaminated foodThrough bacteria such as Salmonella in contaminated food. Food can be contaminated with bacteria by contact with infected people, or when it is prepared in unhygienic conditions.Other animalsThrough animals that scratch, bite or draw blood.VectorAny organism that can spread a disease is called a vector. Mosquitoes are the vectors in the spread of malaria.MalariaMalaria is a disease caused by a protist called Plasmodium. Malaria kills just under half a million people a year worldwide.Plasmodium is a parasite. It spends part of its life cycle in mosquitoes, and part in humans. The mosquito acts as a vector.Mosquitoes that carry malaria are often found in areas with higher temperatures in Africa, Asia, and South and Central America.In the life cycle of Plasmodium, a mosquito sucks blood containing the protists from an infected person. The mosquito passes the protist to other people when it sucks their blood. The mosquitoes are unaffected by the parasite, since they act as vectors.The symptoms of malaria include a fever, sweats and chills, headaches, vomiting and diarrhoea.There is no vaccination for malaria. Infection can only be prevented by stopping individuals from being bitten by the mosquitoes. People sleep under mosquito nets and wear insect repellent to avoid bites. Antimalarial drugs are also taken, which treat the symptoms and can prevent infection.Athlete's footAthlete's foot is a rash caused by a fungus that is found between people's toes. It causes the skin between the toes to become dry, itchy, red and cracked or scaly.The fungus is often found in communal areas such as swimming pool or gym changing rooms. It is transmitted by walking on surfaces that have been previously contaminated or touching infected skin. Athlete's foot can be treated by  antifungal medication.",Lifestyle and health,Plant diseases,Plant diseases,Plant diseases
87,Communicable diseases,"Viral diseasesIllustration of the hepatitis C virusViruses are infective agents made up of  genetic material - DNA or RNA - surrounded by a protein coat.
                
                A virus can live only inside the cells of its host. Most viruses can only live for a short period of time - from a few minutes to several hours - outside a host cell, though some can live longer.When viruses have infected a suitable host cell or cells, they take over the cells and replicate themselves - producing new genetic material and protein coats - thousands of times. These are then assembled into new virus particles. The host cell or cells then burst and other nearby cells can be infected with the virus.Viral infections cannot be treated by antibiotics.HIV/AIDSHIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. This infection is transmitted by body fluids, such as blood, often during unprotected sex, but also through cuts and injecting drugs using shared needles.Immediately after infection, people often suffer mild flu-like symptoms. These pass and for a period of time infected people might not know they are infected.Months or years after the infection of the HIV virus, it becomes active and starts to attack the patient's immune system. HIV at this point has become AIDS. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome.When a patient has AIDS, their immune system is no longer able to deal with other types of infections or cancer.There is currently no cure for HIV/AIDS, although treatments are very effective, and patients can live long healthy lives. Currently, infected people are given combinations of antiviral drugs, which can slow the development of the condition.Percentage of global population with AIDSMeaslesAn illustration  of a measles virusMeasles is a very infectious viral disease that is often caught by young children. It is transmitted through the air in tiny droplets after an infected person sneezes or coughs.The virus causes a fever and skin rash. Measles is usually a mild disease, but if complications arise, it can be very serious. It can cause infection of the eye, ear, respiratory system and brain, and can cause brain damage. It is serious if caught during pregnancy.In the UK, most children in developed countries are given vaccines against measles, but this is not the case throughout the whole world.Bacterial diseasesGonorrhoeaGonorrhoea is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) caused by a bacteria. It is a common infection, especially amongst people aged 15-24.Gonorrhoea causes a burning pain when urinating and often forms a thick yellow or green discharge from an infected person's penis or vagina. If untreated, gonorrhoea can result in infertility.To prevent infection, people can:abstain from having anal, oral or vaginal sexuse a barrier-type of contraception such as a condomGonorrhoea is treated by penicillin, an antibiotic, but resistant strains of the bacterium are developing. It may soon not be possible to treat the disease.SalmonellaSalmonella is a genus of bacteria that causes food poisoning.The toxins produced by the bacteria cause  fever, abdominal cramps, vomiting and diarrhoea.Salmonella is spread by the presence of the bacterium in food. It can be spread:in unhygienic kitchenswhen food such as meat, eggs and poultry, contaminated with the bacterium, is not cooked properlyStructure of a Salmonella bacterium cell",Lifestyle and health,Cells in animals and plants,"Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Interactions with the environment
88,"Risk factors, correlation and causation","Something that increases the likelihood of developing a disease is called a risk factor. For example, smoking is a risk factor for lung cancer.Some diseases, their effects and their risk factors are shown in the table below. Risk factorDiseaseEffectsObesityType 2 diabetesThe body's cells no longer respond to insulin; blood glucose levels cannot be regulated properlyAlcoholCirrhosisScar tissue is formed in the liver; the liver is unable to remove toxinsSmokingLung cancerCarcinogens in cigarette smoke cause cells to become cancerousCorrelationScientists look for patterns in data. These patterns can identify risk factors involved in non-communicable diseases.For instance, data collected have shown links  between developing cancer and:various lifestyle factorschemicals produced in the human body or that enter the bodychemicals in the environmentBelow is an example of how a risk factor has been found. This has come from studies on smoking cigarettes and lung cancer.Historically, in the USA, a pattern can be seen in the amount of cigarette use and the incidence of lung cancer.American Cancer SocietyAs the number of cigarettes smoked has increased over the years, the incidence of lung cancer has increased also. Note that there is a time lag - cancer usually takes some years to develop.There is a clear association, called a correlation, between the variables.With cancer and other non-communicable diseases, scientists have found many correlations.Correlation and causeIf there is a correlation between a particular factor and an outcome, it does not mean that the factor necessarily causes the outcome. Scientists must look for a possible mechanism by which the factor could be the likely cause.In the case of lung cancer, analyses of cigarette smoke have shown that at least 70 of the chemicals present in smoke will cause cancer in laboratory animals which establishes a causal link.",Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Interactions with the environment
89,Cardiovascular disease,"Coronary heart diseaseThe heart is a muscular pump. Like all muscles, it needs oxygen for aerobic respiration so that it can contract. The coronary arteries supply blood, and therefore oxygen, to the heart muscle.The coronary arteries may become blocked by a build-up of fatty material, caused by certain kinds of 'bad' cholesterol. As the fatty material increases, one or more coronary arteries narrow, and can become blocked.If a blockage builds up, the amount of oxygen reaching the heart muscle is reduced. A person will develop chest pain, and if left untreated, a heart attack is the result. Heart attacks result in damage to, or death of the heart muscle. Part of the heart muscle, or the whole heart, will die.Ways of treating cardiovascular diseaseDrugs and surgery can help to control coronary heart disease.StatinsStatins are drugs that help to lower cholesterol in the blood. They do this by lowering its production in the liver.Statins are prescribed for people with heart disease or who have a high risk of developing it. They need to be taken long-term. Cholesterol levels will rise again if a person stops taking them.Some studies have raised concerns regarding the side effects of statin use, while others believe they can bring additional positive benefits.Statins are not suitable for everyone - they should not be prescribed for people with liver disease, or pregnant or breastfeeding women.Some patients taking statins experience side effects such as headaches and memory loss. There have been reports of statins being linked with type 2 diabetes and liver damage.Other people argue that statins should be used more widely. They may protect against other conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, but further research is needed.StentsCoronary arteries that are blocked or have become narrow can be stretched open and have a stent inserted to restore and maintain blood flow.The stent is inserted into a coronary artery in a catheter.Stents can be used in instances where drugs are less effective, and offer a longer term solution. Stents are made from metal alloys and do not lead to an immune response in the patient.Around 75,000 operations are carried out each year. Risk factors depend on the patient's:agegeneral healthwhether they have had a heart attackThe operation is safe as it does not involve surgery, but there is a risk of bleeding, heart attack or stroke.Heart transplantsA heart transplant is required in cases of heart failure. Coronary heart disease can lead to heart failure. The heart fails to pump sufficient blood and organs are starved of oxygen. There are different degrees of severity of heart failure.A donor heart is transplanted. In rare cases, a heart is transplanted along with lungs.A consultant assesses the patient's condition. If other treatments are not managing the heart condition, a transplant may be recommended. The patient will be put on a waiting list. A transplant puts major strain on the body, and the benefits and risks will be evaluated, including whether the patient's condition is sufficiently severe and other health factors.There is a shortage of donor hearts in the UK. Only around 200 transplants are carried out each year in a small number of hospitals.Artificial hearts are plastic devices used occasionally to keep patients alive whilst waiting for a heart transplant. They can also be used to allow a patient's heart to rest to help it recover.An artificial heartAfter the transplant, the patient will:need time to heal, recover and build up strengthhave to take drugs called immunosuppressant drugs for the rest of their life - this prevents the person's immune system from rejecting the donor hearthave an increased risk of infection because of these drugs",Lifestyle and health,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Lifestyle and health,Combined Science
90,Smoking and cardiovascular disease,"Smoking increases the risk of cardiovascular disease in several ways:Smoking damages the lining of the arteries, including the coronary arteries. The damage encourages the build-up of fatty material in the arteries. This can lead to a heart attack or a stroke.Inhalation of carbon monoxide in cigarette smoke reduces the amount of oxygen that can be carried by the blood.The nicotine in cigarette smoke increases the heart rate, putting strain on the heart.Chemicals in cigarette smoke increase the likelihood of the blood clotting, resulting in a heart attack or stroke.Lung diseaseSmoking may result in lung diseases.Sections of a healthy lung and a smoker's lung, showing tar depositsA person may develop COPD _ chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This condition includes the diseases chronic bronchitis and emphysema.In COPD:smoking damages the bronchioles and can eventually destroy many of the alveoli in the lungsthe airways become inflamed and mucus, which normally traps particles in the lungs, builds upthe patient becomes breathless, and finds it more and more difficult to obtain the oxygen required for respirationThe damage caused by COPD is permanent. The disease cannot be cured, and can result in death. It is essential that the person seeks medical help to try to prevent progression of the disease.Lung cancerThe carcinogens in cigarette smoke also cause lung cancer. Almost all cases of lung cancer are caused by smoking _ smaller numbers of cases are linked with air pollution and ionising radiation from radon gas, a radioactiveelement found in the environment in some parts of the country.The vast majority of cases of lung cancer lead to death.Note that the trend in the rate of developing lung cancer for women has been increasing, while in men is decreasing. The main reason is because numbers of female smokers - unlike men - continued to increase in the 1950s and 1960s before starting to fall. Cancer may take some years to develop, so a fall in female rates of lung cancer is likely to occur later. Evidence also suggests that women are more susceptible to developing the condition.Effects of smoking on babiesFor mothers who smoke during pregnancy:smoking increases the risk of miscarriagethe babies and children are more likely to suffer from respiratory infections and an increased risk of asthmathe long-term physical growth and intellectual development of the baby/child is affectedthere is an increased risk of birth defects the birthweight of the baby is reducedThe Medical Journal of AustraliaQuestionThe bar chart shows that when mothers smoke more than ten cigarettes a day, the birthweight of their babies is reduced.Suggest two pieces of additional information that would need to be collected before drawing firm conclusions about the effect of  mothers smoking on the birthweight of babies.Reveal answerupdownCarry out a similar study of mothers of different age groups to see if similar results could be obtained.Check to ensure that other factors - for instance, related to lifestyle factors of the experimental group - could not have affected birthweight.When parents smoke, there is a greater risk of cot death _ sudden infant death syndrome.",Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health

92,Obesity and type 2 diabetes,"Being obese - with deposits of lipids in the abdomen - increases blood pressure beyond normal levels and increases levels of blood lipids.Type 2 diabetesBody fat also affects the body's ability to use insulin.Type 2 diabetes is where the body's cells lose their sensitivity to insulin - they no longer respond, or respond less effectively, to the insulin that's produced.Obesity accounts for 80 to 85% of the risk of type 2 diabetes. Rising obesity is linked with 'western diet' - a diet that includes energy-rich 'fast foods' and an inactive lifestyle.The bar charts show the increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes associated with people's Body Mass Index (BMI).There is no cure for type 2 diabetes, but it may be possible to control it by diet and exercise.The risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes can be reduced by eating a balanced diet, with unrefined, unprocessed, 'whole foods', and taking regular exercise.",Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Homeostasis
93,Cancer and carcinogens,"CancerCells grow then divide by mitosis only when we need new ones - when we're growing or need to replace old or damaged cells.When a cell becomes cancerous, it begins to grow and divide uncontrollably. New cells are produced - even if the body does not need them.A group of cancerous cells produces a growth called a tumour.Types of tumourThere are two types of tumour - benign and malignant. The table shows the difference between the two types:Type of tumourCharacteristicsBenignGrows slowly; usually grow within a membrane, so can easily be removed; does not invade other parts of the bodyMalignantGrows quickly; invades neighbouring tissues and can spread to other parts of the body in the bloodstream; as the tumour grows, cancer cells detach and can form secondary tumours in other parts of the body - this is called metastasis.The diagram shows how cancer cells can invade surrounding tissue:Cancer cells are undifferentiated - they do not carry out their normal function.At some point, secondary tumours may develop.previousnextpreviousnextDevelopment of a tumour1.

Carcinogens cause mutations to occur. A single mutation will not cause cancer - several are required. For this reason, we are more likely to develop cancer as we get older.Something that increases the likelihood of developing a disease is called a risk factor. There are several risk factors for various types of cancers including:Lifestyle factors:viruses linked with cancer, such as the human papilloma virus (HPV), being spread from person to person through sexual intercoursethe chemical carcinogens in cigarette smoke increasing the risk of lung canceralcohol intake is linked with certain cancersexposure to ultraviolet radiation, part of which is ionising, during sunbathing or outdoor activities, leading to the development of skin cancersdiet, including fat and salt intake, increases the risk of cancerIndustrial and environmental factors at work:exposure to ionising radiation increases the risk factorexposure to chemical carcinogensThere are also genetic risk factors for some cancers.",Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Lifestyle and health,Combined Science
94,Homeostasis and temperature regulation,"The conditions inside our body must be carefully controlled if it is to function effectively. Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal environment in the body. The nervous system and the endocrine system - which produces hormones - are involved in homeostasis.The body control systems have three basic parts:Receptors detect a stimulus, which is a change in the environment, such as temperature change.Coordination centres in the brain, spinal cord or a gland (eg the pancreas). These receive information from the receptors, process the information and initiate a response.Effectors, such as muscles or glands produce the response. Muscles would contract while glands would release a hormone, which would restore the optimum condition again.Body temperatureBody temperature is one of the factors that is controlled during homeostasis. The human body maintains the temperature at which enzymes work best, which is around 37°C. This process is controlled by the thermoregulatory centre, which is contained in the hypothalamus in the brain, and it contains receptors sensitive to the temperature of the blood. The skin also has temperature receptors and sends nervous impulses back to the thermoregulatory centre.Too coldWhen we get too cold:Skeletal muscles contract rapidly and we shiver. These contractions need energy from respiration, and some of this is released as heat.Blood vessels, which lead to the skin capillaries, become narrower - they constrict - which allows less blood to flow through the skin and conserve the core body temperature. This is called vasoconstriction.Too hotWhen we get too hot:Sweat glands in the skin release more sweat. The sweat evaporates, transferring heat energy from the skin to the environment.Blood vessels leading to the skin capillaries become wider - they dilate - allowing more blood to flow through the skin, and more heat to be lost to the environment. This is called vasodilation.The hairs on the skin also help to control body temperature. The hairs lie flat when we are warm, and rise when we are cold. If we are too cold, nerve impulses are sent to the hair erector muscles which contract. This raises the skin hairs and traps a layer of insulating air next to the skin.The control of body temperature is an example of a negative feedback mechanism. It regulates the amount of:shivering (rapid muscle contractions release heat)sweating (evaporation of water in sweat causes cooling)blood flowing in the skin capillariesNegative feedback in temperature regulationVasoconstriction and vasodilationThe amount of blood flowing through the skin capillaries is altered by vasoconstriction and vasodilation.Too coldToo hotProcessVasoconstrictionVasodilationArteriolesGet narrowerGet widerBlood flow in skin capillariesDecreasesIncreasesHeat loss from skinDecreasesIncreasesThese diagrams show the processes that take place when vasoconstriction and vasodilation occur. Generally, when the body temperature is too low, a variety of processes happen - vasoconstriction, sweating stops and shivering starts.Vasoconstriction _ a response to being too coldWhen the temperature is too high, different processes happen - vasodilation and sweat production, which both transfer energy from skin to the environment, resulting in a cooling effect.Vasodilation - a response to being too hot",Homeostasis,Homeostasis,Homeostasis,Homeostasis
95,Homeostasis and water balance ,"Osmoregulation is the control of water levels and mineral salts in the blood.
                           
  Water levels and mineral salts in the blood are controlled to protect cells by stopping too much water from entering or leaving them.If body cells lose or gain too much water by osmosis, they do not function efficiently.If the concentration of water is the same inside and out the cells, they remain in their normal state. If the water concentration is too high outside, water enters the cell by osmosis and they may burst. 
                
      
                On the other hand, if the water concentration is too low outside compared with the inside of the cells, water will leave by osmosis and the cells may shrivel. If body cells lose or gain too much water by osmosis, they do not function efficiently.Plants also undergo the process of osmosis, in the same way that animals cells do, but they do not burst when placed in distilled water, because of their cell walls.Plant cells are turgid or firm, when they are full of water.If cell walls lose water, they become flaccid and the cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The cell is said to be plasmolysed.
       
                Human excretory organsThe organs of excretion in humans include the skin, lungs and kidneys.Most of the water is lost from the body as:urine from the kidneyssweat from the skinwater vapour, from the lungs when we exhaleSkinSweat glands in the skin produce sweat. Water, ions and urea are lost from the skin as the body sweats.Cross-section of human skinLungsWater leaves the body via the lungs when we exhale as well as the carbon dioxide produced during respiration.We cannot control the level of water, ion or urea loss by the lungs or skin. For example, in a hot climate, your body sweats to help keep you cool. In the same way, when we breathe out, we lose water vapour, and we cannot alter the amount we lose.KidneysThe kidneys are organs of the urinary system, which removes excess water, salts and urea.",Homeostasis,Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells
96,Control of blood glucose concentration by the pancreas and insulin,"Regulating blood glucoseGlucose is needed by cells for respiration. It is important that the concentration of glucose in the blood is maintained at a constant level and controlled carefully.Insulin is a hormone - produced by the pancreas - that regulates glucose concentrations in the blood.If the blood glucose concentration is too high, the pancreas produces the hormone insulin that causes glucose to move from the blood into the cells. In liver and muscle cells, excess glucose is converted to glycogen for storage, and will be used at a later date.The diagram illustrates how insulin works in the body:",Homeostasis,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Homeostasis,Homeostasis

This can be detected from an early age. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin.A medical diabetes kitPeople with Type 1 diabetes also have to monitor their blood sugar levels throughout the day. Their levels of physical activity and their diet affect the amount of insulin needed.They can help to control their blood glucose level by being careful with their diet, such as eating foods that will not cause large increases in blood sugar level, and by exercising, which can lower blood glucose levels due to increased respiration in the muscles.Type 2 diabetesIn type 2 diabetes, the person's body cells no longer respond to insulin.  It is more common in older people, though since 2000, it is now becoming common in young people also.Type 2 diabetes can usually be controlled by a  carbohydrate controlled diet and an exercise regime. After a meal, carbohydrate is digested into glucose, which raises the overall blood glucose level. There is a correlation between rising levels of obesity in the general population and increasing levels of type 2 diabetes.The correlation between obesity and type 2 diabetesQuestionDescribe the pattern in this data. [5 marks]Reveal answerupdownThe graph shows a range of data from 1990 to 2000. Mean body weight has steadily increased from approximately 72.5 kg in 1990, to 75.5 kg in 1997 up to just over 77 kg in 2000.  [2 marks]This matches a general increase in the number of people with type 2 diabetes from 1990 to 2000. For example, the percentage was just below 5% in 1990 up to just below 7.5% in 2000. This shows an overall increase of 2.5% over 10 years. [2 marks]There are dips and minor peaks within the graph, and these may be due to the introduction of a particular type of food, or other additional factors such as lifestyle, or reporting of diabetes cases.

98,Role of glucagon in control of blood sugar levels - Higher,"Negative feedbackThe hormone insulin plays a key role in blood glucose regulation.When blood sugar rises in the blood, insulin encourages the body's cells to take up glucose. Cells of the liver and muscles  take up and store the excess glucose as glycogen.If the blood glucose level is too low, the liver releases some of that stored glucose into the blood. This change is brought about by another hormone produced by the pancreas called glucagon.This is an example of negative feedback.",Homeostasis,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,Homeostasis,Homeostasis
99,Reproductive hormones,"A hormone is a chemical substance produced by a gland. Hormones are carried by the blood around the body but alter the activity of specific target organs only.Different hormones affect different organs or cells.The location of the endocrine glands in the body - the main hormones involved in reproduction are released by the pituitary gland, ovaries and testesPubertyPuberty is the stage in life when a child's body develops into an adult's body. The changes take place gradually, usually between the ages of 10 and 16.During puberty, reproductive hormones cause secondary sex characteristics to develop:Testosterone - produced by the testes - is the main male reproductive hormone and it stimulates sperm production.Oestrogen - produced by the ovaries - is the main female reproductive hormone. At puberty, eggs begin to mature and one is released approximately every 28 days. This is called ovulation.Changes during pubertyA variety of changes happen to boys and girls during puberty.Boys onlyBoys and girlsGirls onlyVoice breaksPubic hair growsVoice deepens graduallyHair grows on face and bodyUnderarm hair growsHips get widerBody becomes more muscularSexual organs grow and developBreasts developTestes start to produce sperm cellsOvaries start to release egg cells - menstruation starts",Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility
100,The menstrual cycle,"The menstrual cycle is a recurring process which takes around 28 days.During the process, the lining of the uterus is prepared for pregnancy. If implantation of the fertilised egg into the uterus lining does not happen, the lining is then shed. This is known as menstruation.Several hormones are involved in the menstrual cycle of a woman:follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) causes the maturation of an egg in the ovaryluteinising hormone (LH) stimulates the release of the eggoestrogen is involved in repairing and thickening the uterus lining, while progesterone maintains itHormoneWhere producedRoleFSH (follicle stimulating hormone)Pituitary glandCauses an egg to mature in an ovary; stimulates the ovaries to release oestrogenOestrogenOvaries

This maintains the lining of the uterus during pregnancy and means that menstruation does not happen.The interactions of hormones - HigherThe menstrual cycle lasts for approximately 28 days. Graphs can be used to follow changes to the hormones during this process.QuestionDescribe the relationship between the different hormones during the 28 days.Reveal answerupdownDays 1 to 12 - oestrogen gradually increases and peaks approximately on the 12th day. Progesterone, LH and FSH stay approximately at the same levels and begin to increase slightly from around day 12.FSH and LH patterns are very similar and peak during ovulation at approximately 14 days during this cycle. They drop sharply on day 15 and stay constant until day 28.Oestrogen drops during days 13 and 14, and progesterone continues to gradually increase until about day 21, when it slowly beings to decrease again. Oestrogen mirrors this shape and also has a second lower peak at about day 21.Greg Foot describes the interaction of FSH, LS, oestrogen and progesterone in the menstrual cycle",Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility
101,Contraception,"Hormonal contraception Contraceptive pills Human fertility is controlled by hormones, so fertility can be controlled using hormonal forms of contraception.
                        The oral contraceptive, which is known as the pill, contains oestrogen or progesterone. These hormones prevent the production of FSH, so eggs cannot mature.Benefits and risks of hormonal contraceptionOral contraceptives are more than 99% effective if taken correctly and can reduce the risk of certain cancers.However, there are possible side effects, such as changes in weight, mood and blood pressure due to high levels of oestrogen. Modern pills contain much less oestrogen.Contraceptive injections, implants or skin patches contain slow release progesterone to prevent the maturation and release of eggs.Non-hormonal contraceptionFertility can be controlled without hormones.These methods include:physical barrier methods such as condoms and diaphragms, which prevent the sperm reaching an eggintrauterine devices (IUD) also known as a coil, prevent the implantation of an embryo or release of a hormonespermicidal agents which kill or disable spermabstaining from intercourse when an egg may be in the oviductsurgical methods of male and female sterilisation, eg a vasectomy, where the sperm ducts are cut and tiedBenefits and risks of non-hormonal contraceptionCondoms are easy and quick to use, but sometimes they can tear or rip.Diaphragms need to be put in just before sex and left in several hours afterwards.IUDs need to be fitted by a health professional. IUDs can remain in position for up to 10 years. However, there is a small risk of causing an ectopic pregnancy, which leads to complications for both the mother and the foetus.Spermicidal agents can be added to other physical barriers such as condoms, but some people can have allergic reactions to these. Abstaining can be used successfully, but if the timings are not accurate, the chance of pregnancy is high.Surgical methods cannot be reversed, and is considered permanent.",Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility,Reproduction and fertility
102,Infertility treatments - Higher,"Infertility treatments - HigherSome women have difficulty becoming pregnant because they don't produce enough FSH to allow their eggs to mature. Fertility drugs contain FSH and LH, which stimulate eggs to mature in the ovary.Fertility treatments increase a woman's chance of becoming pregnant, although the treatment may not always work. On the other hand, because the treatment boosts the production of mature eggs, it increases the chance of twins or triplets.Multiple pregnancies carry a risk of complications, and may lead to premature or underweight babies.In vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatmentIf a couple are having difficulty conceiving a child because there are issues with the quality of the man's sperm, or a woman has blocked oviducts, then IVF can be used. 
                
                  
                IVF involves giving a mother FSH and LH to stimulate the maturation of several eggs.The eggs are collected from the mother and fertilised by sperm from the father in a dish in the laboratory.The fertilised eggs develop into embryos.At the stage when they are tiny balls of cells, one or two embryos are inserted into the mother's uterus (womb).The development of microscopy techniques has allowed IVF treatments to be developed further.Evaluating infertility treatmentsThe NHS has to choose which couples they can fund for IVF. If they cannot be treated on the NHS, some people choose to pay privately for treatment. This is very expensive, and costs several thousand pounds.The chances of a successful pregnancy vary depending on the age of the woman involved. As a woman's age increases, the chance of conception decreases. In particular, the chances of a woman over the age of 43 becoming pregnant decreases to a 5% success rate.Data from the NHS choices website shows that:In 2010, the percentage of IVF treatments that resulted in a live birth was:32.2% for women under 3527.7% for women aged 35-3720.8% for women aged 38-3913.6% for women aged 40-425% for women aged 43-441.9% for women aged over 44Advantages of IVFIt allows people to have babies of their own, who otherwise can't due to a variety of reasons.It has a safe track record and has been used since 1978. The embryos can be screened for genetic diseases, which is important for families that already have an affected child. Only unaffected embryos are used.Unused eggs can be used for research or donated to other couples.Disadvantages of IVFThere are side effects from the drugs used, such as hot flushes and severe headaches.There is a possibility of multiple births, which is dangerous for mother and babies.Ovarian hyper-stimulation syndrome (OHS), when too many eggs develop in the ovaries.It is very emotionally and physically stressful.The success rates are not high.Ethical concernsSome people worry about the ethical implications of IVF. They are concerned that couples may want 'designer babies' with 'desirable' qualities, so may only want certain fertilised eggs. For example, they may want a girl if they have lots of boys in the family.Also, the embryos that are not used may be destroyed. Some people might view these as new lives, so may consider destroying them to be unethical.",Reproduction and fertility,Cell division,Cell division,Reproduction and fertility
103,Absorption and emission,"When atoms absorb energy, through heating, from electricity, or by absorbing electromagnetic radiation, the electrons at a particular level can be pushed up to higher levels (at bigger distances from the nucleus). In time, they jump back down to a lower level radiating energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. The frequency of the radiation depends on the size of the jump that the electron makes. Sodium has energy levels that cause the electrons to emit yellow light as they drop from one to the other. The energy levels in mercury are further apart and electrons emit ultraviolet radiation when they jump back down.In the diagram, the colours of the 'down arrows' represent the colour of the light emitted as the electron makes that drop.",Radiation and risk,Atomic structure,States of matter,Radiation and risk
104,Nuclear radiation,"Types of radioactive decayAn unstable nucleus can decay by emitting an alpha particle (α), a beta particle (β), a gamma ray (γ) or in some cases a single neutron (n).Alpha particleIf the nucleus has too few neutrons, it will emit a 'package' of two protons and two neutrons called an alpha particle.    An alpha particle is also a Helium-4 nucleus, so it is written as 42He and is also sometimes written as 42α.Alpha decay causes the mass number of the nucleus to decrease by four and the atomic number of the nucleus to decrease by two.Beta particleIf the nucleus has too many neutrons, a neutron will turn into a proton and emit a fast-moving electron. This electron is called a beta particle _ this process is known as beta radiation. A beta particle has a relative mass of zero, so its mass number is zero, and as the beta particle is an electron, it can be written as 0-1e. However sometimes it is also written as 0-1β.curriculum-key-factThe beta particle is an electron but it has come from the nucleus, not the outside of the atom. Electrons are not normally expected to be found in the nucleus but neutrons can split into a positive proton (same mass but positive charge) and an electron (which has a negative charge to balance the positive charge) which is then ejected at high speed and carries away a lot of energy.Beta decay causes the atomic number of the nucleus to decrease by one and the mass number remains the same.Gamma rayAfter emitting an alpha or beta particle, the nucleus will often still be too 'hot' and will lose energy in a similar way to how a hot gas cools down. A hot gas cools by emitting infrared radiation which is an electromagnetic wave. High energy particles will emit energy as they drop to lower energy levels. Since energy levels in the nucleus are much higher than those in the gas, the nucleus will cool down by emitting a more energetic electromagnetic wave called a gamma ray. Gamma ray emission causes no change in the number of particles in the nucleus meaning both the atomic number and mass number remain the same.Neutron emissionOccasionally it is possible for a neutron to be emitted by radioactive decay. This can occur naturally ie absorption of cosmic rays high up in the atmosphere can result in neutron emission, or it can occur artificially, ie the work done by Sir James Chadwick firing alpha particles at Beryllium. Sir James Chadwick graduated from the University of Manchester in 1911 and went to work at the University of Cambridge where, in 1932, he discovered the neutron.Neutron emission causes the mass number of the nucleus to decrease by one and the atomic number remains the same.Properties of nuclear radiations The different types of radiation are often compared in terms of their penetrating power, their ionising power and how far they can travel in the air.SymbolPenetrating powerIonising powerRange in airAlphaαSkin/paperHigh < 5 (cm)Betaβ3 mm aluminium foilLow_ 1 (m)GammaγLead/concreteVery low > 1 (km)All types of radioactive decay can be detected by a Geiger-Muller tube, or G-M tube. The radiations ionise the gas inside and the resulting charged particles move across the chamber and get counted as charges per second rather like an ammeter. ",Radiation and risk,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
105,Radioactive decay,"A nucleus changes into a new element by emitting alpha or beta particles. These changes are described using nuclear equations.Alpha decay (two protons and two neutrons) changes the mass number of the element, decreasing by four and decreasing the atomic number by two. An alpha particle is the same as a helium-4 nucleus.Example\[_{86}^{219}\textrm{Rn} \rightarrow _{84}^{215}\textrm{Po} + _{2}^{4}\textrm{He}\]Beta decay changes the atomic number, increasing by one (the nucleus gains a proton) but the mass number remains unchanged (it gains a proton but loses a neutron by ejecting an electron, so a beta particle is an electron). Example\[_{6}^{14}\textrm{C} \rightarrow _{7}^{14}\textrm{N} + _{-1}^{0}\textrm{e}\]Gamma is pure energy and will not change the structure of the nucleus in any way.QuestionUranium 238, \(_{92}^{238}\textrm{U} \), emits an alpha particle to become what nucleus? Reveal answerupdownAlpha decay (two protons and two neutrons) decreases the mass number of the element by four and decreases the atomic number by two, so the remaining nucleus will be \(_{90}^{234}\textrm{}\). A periodic table shows that element number 90 is thorium, \(_{90}^{234}\textrm{Th} \).",Radiation and risk,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
106,Half-life,"Radioactive decay is a random process. A block of radioactive material will contain many trillions of nuclei and not all nuclei are likely to decay at the same time, so it is impossible to tell when a particular nucleus will decay.It is not possible to say which particular nucleus will decay next but given that there are so many of them, it is possible to say that a certain number will decay in a certain time. Scientists cannot tell when a particular nucleus will decay but they can use statistical methods to tell when half the unstable nuclei in a sample will have decayed. This is called the half-life.Half-life is the time it takes for half of the unstable nuclei in a sample to decay or for the activity of the sample to halve or for the count rate to halve.Count rate is the number of decays recorded each second by a detector, such as the Geiger-Muller tube. This also known as the Activity of the source. One decay per second is known as one Becquerel (Bq).The illustration below shows how a radioactive sample is decaying over time. From the start of timing it takes two days for the count to halve from 80 down to 40. It takes another two days for the count rate to halve again, this time from 40 to 20. Note that this second two days does not see the count drop to zero, only that it halves again. A third, two day period from four days to six days see the count rate halving again from 20 down to 10. This process continues and although the count rate might get very small, it does not drop to zero completely.The half-life of radioactive carbon-14 is 5,730 years. If a sample of a tree (for example) contains 64 grams (g) of radioactive carbon after 5,730 years it will contain 32 g, after another 5,730 years that will have halved again to 16 g.Calculating the isotope remaining - HigherIt should also be possible to state how much of a sample remains or what the activity or count should become after a given length of time.  This could be stated as a fraction, decimal or ratio.For example the amount of a sample remaining after four half-lives could be expressed as:A fraction _ a \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a \(\frac{1}{2}\) of a \(\frac{1}{2}\) remains which is \(\frac{1}{2}\) _ \(\frac{1}{2}\) _ \(\frac{1}{2}\) _ \(\frac{1}{2}\) = \(\frac{1}{16}\) of the original sample.A decimal _ \(\frac{1}{16}\) = 0.0625 of the original sample.A ratio _ given in the form 'activity after n half-lives : initial activity'. In this case 1:16.This could then be incorporated into other data. So if the half-life is two days, four half-lives is 8 days. So suppose a sample has a count rate of 3,200 Becquerel (Bq) at the start, its count rate after 8 days would be \(\frac{1}{16}\)th of 3,200 Bq = 200 Bq.ExampleThe half-life of cobalt-60 is 5 years. If there are 100 g of cobalt-60 in a sample, how much will be left after 15 years?15 years is three half-lives so the fraction remaining will be \(( \frac{1}{2})^{3}\) = \(\frac{1}{8}\) = 12.5 g. As a ratio of what was present originally compared to what was left, this would be 100:12.5 or 1:0.125.Question What is the half-life of a sample where the activity drops from 1,200 Bq down to 300 Bq in 10 days? Reveal answerupdownHalf of 1,200 is 600, half of 600 is 300. So it takes two half-lives to drop from 1,200 Bq to 300 Bq, which is 10 days. Therefore, one half-life is five days.ExampleTechnetium-99 is used in medicine and emits gamma rays. The original sample has a measured activity of 2,000 Bq. Over a twelve hour period this has dropped to 500 Bq. What is the half-life?After one half-life 2,000 Bq drops to 1,000 Bq. After another half-life 1,000 Bq drops to 500 Bq. So there have been two half lives in the twelve hour period. This means one half life is six hours.",Radiation and risk,Atomic structure,States of matter,Radiation and risk
107,Contamination and irradiation,"IrradiationShining visible radiation from a torch beam onto a hand lights the hand up because the hand has been exposed to light. Exposing objects to beams of radiation is called irradiation. The term applies to all types of radiation including radiation from the nuclei of atoms.Irradiation from radioactive decay can damage living cells. This can be put to good use as well as being a hazard. Radioactive beams can be used to preserve fruit by exposing the fruit to a radioactive source, typically Cobalt 60. The gamma rays emitted by the cobalt will destroy any bacteria on the fruit but will not alter the fruit in any significant way.Irradiation does not cause radioactivity.The method can also be used to sterilise surgical instruments. ContaminationContamination occurs if an object has a radioactive material introduced into (or onto) it. An apple exposed to the radiation from cobalt-60 is irradiated but an apple with cobalt-60 injected into it is contaminated. As with irradiation, contamination can be very useful as well as being potentially harmful. Doctors can deliberately contaminate a patient's body when it will help with diagnosis with a radioactive source, such as:drinking a radioactive mixture (barium meal) will make soft tissue such as your intestine show up on an x-raytechnetium-99 is a radioactive isotope that can be introduced into the body to make soft tissue such as the brain or the thyroid show up on a scannerIrradiation versus contaminationThe two processes of irradiation and contamination are often confused. However they are very different and useful in their own right.IrradiationContaminationOccurs when an object is exposed to a source of radiation outside the object.Occurs if the radioactive source is on or in the object.Doesn't cause the object to become radioactive.A contaminated object will be radioactive for as long as the source is on or in it.Can be blocked with suitable shielding or moving away.Once an object is contaminated, the radiation cannot be blocked from it.Stops as soon as the source is removed.It can be very difficult to remove all of the contamination.",Radiation and risk,Waves,Radiation and risk,Atomic structure
108,Ionising radiations,"Normally, atoms are neutral. They have the same number of protons in the nucleus as they have electrons orbiting in the energy levels around the nucleus.Atoms can, however, lose or gain electrons due to collisions or other interactions, often with nuclear radiation. When they do, they form charged particles called ions:if the atom loses one or more electrons, it becomes a positively-charged ionif the atom gains one or more electrons, it becomes a negatively-charged ionRadioactive materials are hazardous. Nuclear radiation can ionise chemicals within a body, which changes the way the cells behave. It can also deposit large amounts of energy into the body, which can damage or destroy cells completely. Ultraviolet, x-rays, alpha, beta and gamma radiations are all examples of ionising radiations. Molecules in cells can be altered as well as the DNA.Some of the effects that radiation has on a human body are shown below.EyesHigh doses can cause cataracts.ThyroidRadioactive iodine can build up and cause cancer, particularly during growth.LungsBreathing in radioisotopes can damage DNA.StomachRadioactive isotopes can sit in the stomach and irradiate for a long time.Reproductive organsHigh doses can cause sterility or mutations.SkinRadiation can burn skin or cause cancer.Bone marrowRadiation can cause leukaemia and other diseases of the blood.",Radiation and risk,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Ionic compounds
109,What is cancer?,"Normal body cells grow and divide to form new cells. Skin cells last a few weeks before they die and fall off the body as dust, brain cells can last an entire lifetime.The chemicals that form the genetic code in the cells can be altered by ionising radiations. This can affect the way the cell divides and new cells may be formed before they are needed.A cancerous human lung cell in the process of dividingA large mass of tissue, containing these new unnecessary cells, is called a tumour. Tumours may be benign. Benign tumours stay where they are and are relatively easy to operate on and remove.A malignant tumour contains cells that break away and travel through the blood system to other parts of the body. These cells then go on to form new tumours and the cancer spreads. Beams of gamma rays, called a gamma knife, can be used to destroy cancerous tumours deep inside the body. The beams are aimed at the tumour from many different directions to maximise the dose on the tumour but to minimise the dose on the surrounding soft tissue. This technique can damage healthy tissue, so careful calculations are done to establish the best dose _ enough to destroy the tumour but not so much so that the healthy tissue is damaged.

110,Reducing radiation risks,"The risk associated with radioactive materials depends on the amount of exposure. Being exposed to radioactive materials for long periods of time or on a regular basis  increases the dose received which, in turn, increases the risk.curriculum-key-factRisk is the likelihood of cell damage occurring.Given that radioactive materials are hazardous, certain precautions can be taken to reduce the risk of using radioactive sources. These include:keep radioactive sources like technetium-99 shielded (preferably in a lead-lined box) when not in usewear protective clothing to prevent the body becoming contaminated should radioactive isotopes leak outavoid contact with bare skin and do not attempt to taste the sourceswear face masks to avoid breathing in materialslimit exposure time to radioactive materialshandle radioactive materials with tongs in order to keep a safer distance from sourcesmonitor exposure using detector badgesThe Sievert (Sv) is the unit used to measure radiation dose and is the amount of damage that would be caused by the absorption of 1 joule of energy in each kilogram of body mass.  Typically, absorption is less than 1 Sv, so milliSieverts (mSv) are often used instead. 1,000 mSv = 1 Sv.Some example doses are shown below:Eating a banana that contains radioactive potassium0.000000098 Sv0.000098 mSvExposure for cabin crew on airliners (per year)0.0016 Sv1.6 mSv6 months on the International Space station0.08 Sv80 mSvHighest dose to a worker during Fukushima disaster0.67 Sv670 mSvTypical fatal dose10 Sv10,000 mSvThe perception of a risk can often differ from the measured risk. The risk of unfamiliar things (such as skydiving) and things that have an invisible effect (like ionising radiation) are often overestimated by people. People who are worried about working with radioactive materials may turn down a job in any situation where radioactive materials are used whereas, in fact the real risk may be very different from the perceived risk, eg the risk that you think is there.Nuclear radiation is invisible, and sounds threatening to many people. This makes the risk seem worse than something you can see, and which is more familiar. Many people do not realise that nuclear radiation has always been part of our environment.Some people are afraid that irradiated food is itself radioactive, even though this is not true.",Radiation and risk,Radiation and risk,Radiation and risk,Energy changes

113,Vaccinations,"Pathogens are microbes that cause diseases.Vaccines allow a small quantity of dead or a weakened form of the disease-causing pathogen to be introduced into the body. This causes the immune system, to produce antibodies that are specific to the pathogen. Antibodies, which target and attach to the pathogen, destroy the pathogen.The white blood cells then stop producing the antibodies specific to the pathogen and die. However, white blood cells called memory cells remain, and these can be produced very quickly if the immunised patient is exposed to the live pathogen.During the primary infection the antibodies slowly increase, peak at around ten days and then gradually decrease. A second exposure to the same pathogen causes the white blood cells to respond quickly in order to produce lots of the relevant antibodies, which prevents infection.Herd immunityFollowing a vaccination, a person can become immune to the specific disease. This immunity gives protection against illness in an individual. The majority of the population must be vaccinated against serious diseases, which can reduce the chance of people coming into contact with specific pathogens, leading to herd immunity.If the number of people vaccinated against a specific disease drops in a population, it leaves the rest of the population at risk of mass infection, as they are more likely to come across people who are infected and contagious. This increases the number of infections, as well as the number of people who could die from a specific infectious disease.Data sourced from Public Health England's Green Book (2013)QuestionDescribe the pattern of measles cases between 1950 and 1968, when the measles vaccine was introduced.Reveal answerupdownIn 1950 approximately 380,000 cases of measles were detected.

These can have a positive effect like medicines, or a negative one like many illegal drugs.Medicinal drug types include:painkillersantibioticsPainkillers are chemicals that relieve the symptoms but do not kill the pathogens. Common examples include paracetamol and aspirin, and they can relieve a headache or a sore throat.AntibioticsAntibiotics are substances that kill bacteria, or slow down or stop their growth.Examples include amoxicillin - a type of penicillin and ciprofloxacin.Antibiotics can be taken to cure the disease by killing the pathogen, but only cure bacterial diseases - they cannot kill viruses.PenicillinA bacterial cell damaged by penicillinPenicillin was the first antibiotic, discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming. He noticed that some bacteria he had left in a Petri dish had been killed by the naturally occurring Penicillium mould.How do antibiotics work?Antibiotics damage the bacterial cells but do not damage the host cells. They have the ability to cure some bacterial diseases that would have previously killed many people. Since their introduction, they have had a large influence on the world's health and death rate.Antibiotic resistanceSince penicillin was discovered, the use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases has increased exponentially. Antibiotics are being overused in many ways in our world today.Commonly prescribed antibiotics are becoming less effective due to a number of reasons:their overuse - patients are often prescribed antibiotics when they would get better without themfailing to complete the fully prescribed course by a doctor - completing the course means that all bacteria are killed, and so none survive and subsequently mutate to produce resistant strainsuse of antibiotics in farming, where they are used to prevent disease in intensively-farmed animals - antibiotic resistance in farmed animals could spread to humansThese can lead to the effectiveness of antibiotics being reduced, and the incidence of antibiotic resistance increasing. These bacteria are commonly known in the media as superbugs.Ways to reduce antibiotic resistance:only take antibiotics when necessarytreat specific bacteria with specific antibioticshigh hospital hygiene levels, including regular hand washing by staff and visitorspatients who are infected with antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria should be isolated from other patientsThe futureSome antibiotics are kept in reserve as a last resort - when others fail. But some bacteria are now becoming resistant to these.The development of new antibiotics has slowed in recent years. Drugs companies have little financial incentive to develop antibiotics that would only be used very occasionally if none of the other types worked.Antibiotic development has now increased again, however, as governments realise that this will be required to avert a global catastrophe. Drugs companies are also adopting new strategies to kill bacteria - one approach might make bacteria suicidal. Researchers are also investigating the genomes of pathogens and researching genomic approaches to fighting disease.","Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Lifestyle and health,"Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Interactions with the environment
115,Testing new drugs,"New drugs are being developed all the time. Historically drugs have come from nature, as parts of plants and microorganisms have been extracted. One of the most famous discoveries was made by Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin from the Penicillium mould.This antibiotic is still very important in the fight against disease.Plant extractsCertain drugs can be extracted from natural sources, and have been known about for a long time. For example, willow bark was used by the ancient Greeks to help cure fevers and pains. It was later discovered that the active ingredient was salicylic acid. This was modified by chemists into the substance we call aspirin, which is less irritating to the stomach than salicylic acid.Another example is the heart drug, digitalis which is extracted from the foxglove plant.Plants are still important in providing new drugs today, but most plant drugs are now created in a laboratory by scientists at pharmaceutical companies. Many of these companies now produce synthetic versions of the plant extracts, and also use these as the starting point to develop new drugs.New medical drugs have to be tested to ensure that they work, and are safe, before they can be prescribed.What drugs are tested forNew drugs need to be tested and trialled before doctors prescribe them and patients take them. This allows drugs to be checked for:safety (toxicity) - this is important as the potential drugs may be toxic and have other side effects that might harm peopleeffectiveness (efficacy) - to check how effective the new drug will be against the diseasedosage - the optimum quantity required to treat the disease is investigated - it is likely that a certain dose of the new drug will be required for it to be effective, but too high a dose might be toxic, or would be wastefulThree stages of testing drugsThere are three main stages of testing:Preclinical drug trialsThe drugs are tested using computer models and skin cells grown using human stem cells in the laboratory.
            
            
            
            This allows the efficacy and possible side effects to be tested. Many substances fail this first test of a preclinical drug trial because they damage cells or do not seem to work.Animal testingDrugs that pass the first stage are tested on animals. In the UK, new medicines have to undergo these tests. But it is illegal to test cosmetics and tobacco products on animals. A typical test involves giving a known amount of the substance to the animals, then monitoring them carefully for any side effects.Human clinical trialsDrugs that have passed animal tests are used in human clinical trials. They are tested on healthy volunteers to check that they are safe. The substances are then tested on people with the illness to ensure that they are safe and that they work. Low doses of the drug are used initially, and if this is safe the dosage increases until the optimum dosage is identified.The placebo effect occurs when someone feels they are better when they have been given a dummy form of the drug, not the drug itself.To reduce the placebo effect in drug testing:in blind trials only, the doctor knows which patients have been given the drug and which have been given the placeboin double blind trials, neither the doctor nor the patient knows who has been given the drug or placeboThere is a small amount of risk involved in many choices we take in our lives. There is some risk involved in volunteering to be in a drug trial. Some people choose to do this though. Sometimes sick people volunteer to try a newly developed type of treatment. Other volunteers are healthy. They are paid a small sum of money to participate. Drug testing on humans is an important part of the process described above.","Preventing, treating and curing diseases","Preventing, treating and curing diseases","Preventing, treating and curing diseases","Preventing, treating and curing diseases"
116,Genetic modification,"New medical products are also produced by genetic modification (GM) - also called genetic engineering.This involves modifying the genome of an organism by introducing a gene from another organism to result in a desired characteristic.Genetic modification involves these steps:selection of the desired characteristicthe gene responsible for the characteristic is 'cut out' of the chromosome using enzymesthe gene is transferred and inserted into the DNA of another organismgrowth of the modified organism to produce the new productCurrent uses of genetic modificationType 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. The affected person cannot control their blood glucose levels.Type 1 diabetes can be controlled by injecting insulin. The extra insulin allows the glucose to be taken up by the liver and other tissues, which results in cells receiving the glucose they need, and blood glucose levels stay normal.Previously, insulin was extracted from the pancreas of pigs or cattle, but these do not have an identical composition to human insulin. Bacterial cells have been genetically modified - by inserting the human gene for insulin production into their plasmids so that the bacteria produce human insulin.This diagram shows how the genetic modification of the bacterium works:Here the human gene for insulin is inserted into a plasmid. This is a small closed circle of DNA present naturally in bacteria. When the bacterium divides, all the bacteria will carry the plasmid, and produce human insulin.Other examples of genetic modificationSheep and goats have been genetically modified to produce chemicals in their milk that can be used to treat disease. In one example the milk produced contains a protein needed to treat patients with cystic fibrosis.Research is also exploring the possibility of providing tissues needed for transplants from animals that have been genetically modified so that the tissues are not rejected by the human immune system.Potential benefits and risks of genetic modificationThere is no doubt that the genetic engineering of bacteria and yeast to produce insulin has revolutionised the treatment of insulin. Because it is 'human' insulin, it does not have the potential side effects of injecting pig or cattle insulin.But many people do have concerns about inserting human genes into other organisms. The organism involved is Escherichia coli - E. coli for short - whose not genetically modified form is found in huge numbers in the human large intestine.","Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells,Inheritance
117,Stem cells,"Find out where stem cells come from and how they are used in humans and plantsStem cells in humansStem cells are cells that have not undergone differentiation. A cell which has not yet become specialised is called undifferentiated.An embryo develops from a fertilised egg. Cells at the early stages in the development of the embryo are stem cells.If cells are removed from the embryo - called embryonic stem cells - they will differentiate into any cell type.Some stem cells remain in the bodies of adults - adult stem cells. Adult stem cells are found in limited numbers at certain locations in the body.Adult stem cells can be found in several regions of the body, including the: braineyesbloodheartliverbone marrowskinmuscleAdult stem cells can differentiate into related cell types only, for instance, bone marrow cells can differentiate into blood cells and cells of the immune system but not other cell types.","Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Cell division,Cell division,Cell division
118,Using stem cells,"Stem cells can divide to produce new cells, which can then divide into different cell types. They therefore have the potential to be transplanted into patients to treat medical conditions and disease. They could be used to replace cells that have been damaged or destroyed, eg:in heart diseasein type 1 diabetesin cases of multiple sclerosis, which can lead to paralysisin cases of spinal cord or brain injury, that have led to paralysisThe stem cells used could be:embryonic stem cellsadult stem cellsEmbryonic stem cells can differentiate into a wider range of cell types, but are difficult to obtain and their use raises ethical challenges. The best source is the five-day-old embryo.Adult stem cells will differentiate into a narrower range of cell types. Bone marrow transplants are an example of adult stem cell transplant. Bone marrow cells will differentiate into different types of blood cell. Bone marrow transplants are carried out:in cases of blood cell cancer such as leukaemia and lymphomawhen blood cells have been destroyed by cancer treatmentBenefits and risks associated with the use of stem cells in medicineStem cells have great potential in treating patients with currently untreatable conditions, growing organs for transplants, and research. But there are clinical, ethical and social issues with their use. These issues will be different for growth and transplant of adult, embryonic and therapeutically-cloned stem cells. They will also depend on whether the stem cells are to be used for therapy or research.It is important to obtain a balanced view. Sometimes, there are no right or wrong answers, or even answers at all.Some variables which would be considered when discussing stem cells include:Clinical issuesThere is no guarantee how successful these therapies will be, for example, the use of stem cells in replacing nerve cells lost in Parkinson's disease patients.The current difficulty in finding suitable stem cell donors.The difficulty in obtaining and storing a patient's embryonic stem cells. These would have to be collected before birth - some clinics offer to store blood from the umbilical cord when a person is born.Mutations have been observed in stem cells cultured for a number of generations, and some mutated stem cells have been observed to behave like cancer cells.Cultured stem cells could be contaminated with viruses which would be transferred to a patient.Ethical issuesA source of embryonic stem cells is unused embryos produced by IVF (in vitro fertilisation).For therapeutic cloning, is it right to create embryos for therapy and destroy them in the process?Embryos could come to be viewed as a commodity, and not as an embryo that could develop into a person.At what stage of its development should an embryo be regarded as, and treated as a person?Social issuesEducating the public about what stem cells can, and can__ do, is important.Whether the benefits of stem cell use outweigh the objections.Much of the research is being carried out by commercial clinics, so reported successes are not subject to peer review. Patients could be exploited by paying for expensive treatments and being given false hope of a cure as stem cell therapies are only in their developmental stages.","Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Cell division,Cell division,Combined Science
119,Disease interactions,"Diseases can be grouped into two types:communicable, which can be transferred from one person to another, or from one organism to another, eg in humans, these include measles, food poisoning and malarianon-communicable, which are not transferred between people or other organismsNon-communicable diseases include:cancerdiabetesgenetic diseases and conditionsheart diseaseneurological disordersNon-communicable diseases, such as heart disease, cancer and diabetes, are the leading cause of death in the world.Different types of disease may interact.Defects in the immune system mean that an individual is more likely to suffer from infectious diseases. 
For instance, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections, which lead to AIDS, affect the immune system and lead to an increase in infectious diseases.
Viruses living in cells can be the trigger for cancers. For instance, the majority of cases of cancer of the cervix are linked with a virus present in the female reproductive system.
The reaction of the immune system to pathogens and other foreign bodies can trigger allergic reactions that lead to skin rashes and asthma. For instance, severe respiratory infections in babies can lead to asthma in later childhood.Severe physical ill health can lead to depression and other types of mental illness.","Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Lifestyle and health,"Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Interactions with the environment
120,The Earth's early atmosphere,"The Earth formed approximately 4.6 billion years ago. Scientists cannot be certain about what gases made up the Earth's early atmosphere. Ideas about how the atmosphere was produced and how it has changed have developed over time as new evidence has been discovered. There is still not enough evidence for scientists to be certain.Where did the atmosphere come from?One theory suggests that the early atmosphere came from intense volcanic activity, which released gases that made the early atmosphere very similar to the atmospheres of Mars and Venus today:a large amount of carbon dioxidelittle or no oxygensmall amounts of other gases, such as ammonia and methaneVolcanic activity also released water 
vapour, which condensed as the Earth cooled to form the oceans. Nitrogen was probably also released by volcanoes which gradually built up in the atmosphere because it is unreactive.A volcano in Iceland",The atmosphere,States of matter,The atmosphere,States of matter
121,Changes to the atmosphere,"Carbon dioxide is a very soluble gas. It dissolves readily in water. As the oceans formed, carbon dioxide dissolved to form soluble carbonate compounds so the amount in the atmosphere decreased. Carbonate compounds were then precipitated as sedimentary rocks, eg limestone.Carbon dioxide was also absorbed from the oceans when the first plants and algae carried out photosynthesis. Many of these organisms, and those in the food chains that they supported were turned into fossil fuels, eg crude oil, coal and natural gas, which all contain carbon.Crude oil and natural gas were formed from simple plants and tiny animals which were living in oceans and lakes. These small organisms died and their remains sank to the bottom where they were buried under sediments. The lack of oxygen prevented oxidation from occurring.Over millions of years, heat and pressure turned the remains of the organisms into crude oil and natural gas. Natural gas contains the smallest molecules and is often found on top of crude oil, trapped under sedimentary rock.QuestionDescribe two reasons why the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere decreased over time. Reveal answerupdownCarbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans and primitive plants/algae used it for photosynthesis.Plants make their own food by photosynthesis. In this process, carbon dioxide is reacted with water to produce glucose, with oxygen as a by-product:carbon dioxide + water _ glucose + oxygen6CO2+ 6H2O_ C6H12O6+ 6O2Scientists think that algae first evolved approximately 2.7 billion years ago, and soon after this oxygen began to exist in the atmosphere. Photosynthesis by primitive plants and algae released oxygen, which gradually built up in the atmosphere. Eventually, the amount of oxygen present in the atmosphere enabled animals to evolve. Photosynthesis also decreased the amount of carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere.Blue-green algae cells, viewed using an electron microscope",The atmosphere,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,The atmosphere,Combined Science
122,The carbon cycle,"Carbon is an essential element for life on Earth and most biological molecules include carbon atoms. Carbon is present in:carbon dioxide gas in the atmospherecarbon dioxide dissolved in the oceanscalcium carbonate in the shells of sea creaturescalcium carbonate in the form of limestonehydrocarbon compounds in fossil fuelscarbohydrate molecules in living organismsThe carbon cycle shows how atoms of this element are cycled between different compounds within the biotic and abiotic components of an ecosystem at different times.previousnextpreviousnextStage one of the carbon cycleCarbon enters the atmosphere as carbon dioxide from respiration and combustion.previousnextStage two of the carbon cycleCarbon dioxide is absorbed by producers to make carbohydrates in photosynthesis.previousnextStage three of the carbon cycleAnimals feed on plants, passing the carbon compounds along the food chain. Most carbon they consume is exhaled as carbon dioxide during respiration. The animals and plants eventually die.previousnextStage four of the carbon cycleDead organisms are eaten by decomposers and carbon in their bodies is returned to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide. In some conditions decomposition is blocked. The plant and animal material may then be available as fossil fuel in the future for combustion.The carbon cycle is easiest to understand in terms of its processes and the conversion of carbon that they undertake. The three key processes and their conversions are shown in the table below.ProcessCarbon starts asCarbon ends asPhotosynthesisCarbon dioxideGlucoseRespirationGlucoseCarbon dioxideCombustion (burning)Fuel (eg methane or wood)Carbon dioxideAlmost all living things depend on photosynthesis in producers (eg green plants). This process converts carbon dioxide into carbohydrates which support other living things. Animals feed on plants, so the carbon compounds are passed along food chains. Animals and plants respire, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere.When dead plants and animals are decomposed by microorganisms, carbon dioxide is released to the atmosphere and mineral ions are returned to the soil.",The atmosphere,Exchange surfaces and transport systems,The atmosphere,Electrons and chemical reactions
123,The greenhouse effect,"Without greenhouse gases in its atmosphere, the Earth would be about 18 °C colder on average than it is now. That would make it too cold to support life as we know it. Greenhouse gases present in the atmosphere include:water vapourcarbon dioxidemethaneThese greenhouse gases:absorb heat radiated from the Earththen release energy in all directions, which keeps the Earth warmThe diagram gives more details about this process. It is called the greenhouse effect.How the greenhouse effect worksQuestionName three greenhouse gases.Reveal answerupdownCarbon dioxide, methane and water vapour.Comparison of gases - HigherDifferent substances in the atmosphere may absorb, transmit or reflect electromagnetic waves in different ways, depending on the wavelengths of the radiation.GasShort wavelength radiation (eg ultra violet)Long wavelength radiation (eg infra red)NitrogenTransmitTransmitOxygenTransmitTransmitCarbon dioxideTransmitAbsorbMethaneTransmitAbsorbThe information in the table shows that carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases because they absorb the long wavelength radiation from the Earth.",The atmosphere,The atmosphere,The atmosphere,The atmosphere
124,Global warming,"Climate versus weatherClimate is different from weather because climate refers to the average temperature and cycles of weather over long periods of time _ decades at least. People might talk about the weather being windy last week, or hotter last year than the year before. But unless the data is compared for many years a judgment cannot be made about whether the climate is changing.Are humans causing global warming?Human activities are increasing the amount of some greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. For example:burning fossil fuels in industry, vehicles and power stations releases carbon dioxidedeforestation releases carbon dioxide when trees are burnt and reduces the absorption of carbon dioxide through photosynthesisfarming cattle and growing rice in paddy fields releases methaneMethane is released by rice paddy fieldsThe amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased over the past 150 years as a result of human activities.The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere passed 0.04% in 2016Over the same time, the average temperature of the surface of the Earth has also increased.The Earth's average temperature has gradually increased over timeOne of the commonly used pieces of evidence that humans are causing global warming is that there is a strong correlation between the increase in global carbon dioxide levels caused by human activities and the increase in global temperatures over the same timescale.Not everyone in the world agrees that humans are causing global warming by causing the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Some people believe that the current and ongoing rise in global temperatures is being caused by natural factors and cycles of climate change.However, the vast majority of scientists do believe that humans are responsible for the increase in greenhouse gases and therefore global warming. This is because the majority of evidence in peer-reviewed journals  supports the theory that human activities are causing an increase in greenhouse gases and this is causing global warming.Climate science is complicated and it is difficult to predict what will happen to greenhouse gas emissions in the future, so scientists cannot be certain about global warming. Data is analysed using computer models based on the physics that describes the movements of mass and energy in the atmosphere and oceans. The climate is affected by many factors, and detailed data is not available from all locations on Earth, leading to uncertainties in the predictions.

125,Global warming and climate change,"Global warming is the gradual increase in the average surface temperature of the Earth. One impact of global warming is climate change, which is a long-term change in weather patterns.Examples of climate change include:patterns of rainfall changing changes to weather extremesThe effects of global warming, and the climate change that it causes,  include:more frequent floods and droughtsglaciers and polar ice meltingsea levels risingloss of habitatstemperature and water stress for humans and wildlifechanges in the distribution of specieschanges in the ability of some regions to produce foodWe are already experiencing some of these effects. The consequences of global warming, including  climate change, will affect billions of people, all around the world.QuestionSuggest two reasons why global warming leads to rising sea levels. Reveal answerupdownWater from melting glaciers and polar ice enters the oceans. As the Earth's temperature increases, seawater warms up and expands.Reducing the effects of global warmingThe rate of global warming can be reduced by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are being released. For example:using energy resources more efficiently, eg more cars with a higher fuel efficiencyusing renewable sources of energy (eg solar power) instead of fossil fuelsreducing waste by recycling (eg plastic bottles)reducing deforestation (eg reducing the conversion of rainforest to farmland)regenerating forests (planting trees)developing techniques to capture and store the carbon dioxide released from power stations",The atmosphere,The atmosphere,The atmosphere,Combined Science
126,Air pollutants,"When fuels are burned, a number of atmospheric pollutants are produced.
Here are some of the pollutants from burning fuels, and where they come from:
PollutantSourceCarbon dioxide, CO2Complete combustion of any fuel containing carbon atomsCarbon monoxide, COIncomplete combustion of any fuel containing carbon atomsParticulate carbon, C (soot)Incomplete combustion of any fuel containing carbon atomsUnburned hydrocarbonsHydrocarbon fuel molecules which have not been oxidised at allSulfur dioxide, SO2Combustion of a fossil fuel which contains sulfur impuritiesNitrogen oxides, NOxOxidation of nitrogen from the air inside the engine of a car, lorry, etcCarbon monoxide as a pollutantIncomplete combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel occurs when there is not enough oxygen for complete combustion, caused by a poor supply of air. Less energy is released. Instead of carbon dioxide, you might get carbon monoxide or particulate carbon, known commonly as soot, or a mixture of both.Carbon monoxide is a poisonous gas which binds to haemoglobin in red blood cells, preventing them from carrying oxygen to the cells in the body. Carbon monoxide is colourless and has no smell, so it is very difficult to tell if it's being inhaled. At low doses it reduces the ability of the blood to carry oxygen, which puts a strain on the heart. At high doses, it can be fatal.Particulates as a pollutantParticulates (eg particulate carbon from diesel engines, dust from roads and industry) can cause health problems for humans because it irritates the lining of the lungs, eg it can make asthma worse. The smaller particulates are able to travel deeper into the lung tissue and cause damage that could lead to cancer and heart disease.Sulfur dioxide as a pollutantSome fossil fuels contain sulfur impurities. These fuels include:coal burnt in some power stationssome diesel fuel burnt in ships and heavy vehiclesSulfur dioxide is caused when the sulfur atoms are oxidised:sulfur + oxygen _ sulfur dioxideS + O2 _ SO2Sulfur dioxide then reacts with oxygen and water in moist air to make acid rain, which is a dilute solution of sulfuric acid, H2SO4.Acid rain harms and kills plants and animals, especially those that live in water. It can also damage man-made objects like statues and buildings.NOx gases as pollutantsNitrogen is not present in fuels, but the high temperatures and pressures inside a car engine can cause the nitrogen and oxygen in the air to react together to make oxides of nitrogen. There are several compounds formed when nitrogen bonds with oxygen, but the two which are made inside engines are NO and NO2. These two pollutants are grouped together with the general formula NOx.NOx gases can cause acid rain, and they also react in the atmosphere with other pollutants to make photochemical smog. Smog can have major health effects, causing asthma attacks and even death.QuestionDiesel sometimes contains sulfur impurities. List the pollutants which could be produced when it is burned incompletely inside a car engine.

127,The water cycle,"Water is a key compound for life on Earth. All living organisms need water. Some can survive in a dormant state without it for long periods of time, but all organisms will quickly or eventually die without it. Water is also a habitat for many organisms in oceans, rivers and lakes.Water acts as the solvent for chemical reactions in the cytoplasm of all living cells. It also helps to transport dissolved substances into and out of cells. Water is also a reactant or product of many biochemical processes. For example:water is a reactant in photosynthesiswater is a product in respirationwater  is a reactanct/product in digestionWater is found on Earth in all three states of matter:as a solid in glaciers and ice sheetsas a liquid in oceans, rivers, lakes and aquifersas a gas in the atmosphereWater cycles through the environment via a number of processes (including freezing, melting, evaporating and condensing) which together make the water cycle.The water cycle, showing the key stages of the processThe water cycle is easiest to understand in terms of its processes and what happens to the water in each of these. These are the key processes:ProcessWhat happens to waterEvaporationWater turns from a liquid to a gas when it evaporates. Energy from the Sun can evaporate water from all places on the Earth__ surface such as puddles, ponds, lakes and oceans.CondensationAfter evaporation water can cool and convert from gas to liquid, often forming clouds.TransportWater within clouds can be blown many miles by strong winds and so transported to other areas.PrecipitationPrecipitation occurs when rain, snow, hail and sleet fall from the sky.Surface runoffMuch water will be absorbed into the ground after precipitation but if a large volume falls or the ground is already wet some water can run along the surface of the ground.InfiltrationThis occurs when water that has fallen as precipitation is absorbed into the ground. This can then be stored within underground rocks called aquifers.TranspirationPlants need to maintain a constant stream of water to their leaves for transport and support. So they allow some water to evaporate as water vapour from their leaves to mean that more is continually __ulled_ to their leaves from the soil.",Water,Water,The atmosphere,States of matter
128,Potable water,"Water that is safe for humans to drink is called potable water. Potable water is not pure water because it almost always contains dissolved impurities.For water to be potable, it must have sufficiently low levels of dissolved salts and microbes. This is because:dissolved salts can sometimes be harmful for humansmicrobes can cause illnessesPotable water in the UKThe methods used to make water potable depend on where you live. Starting with fresh water is easier than sea water, as removing the large amount of dissolved salt  present in sea water requires a lot of energy.Rain provides water with low levels of dissolved substances. In the UK, rain provides sufficient water to meet the needs of the population, although sometimes it needs to be stored and transported. Sometimes during the summer months in some areas of the UK, water reserves run low and hosepipe bans are used to encourage people to conserve water. Most potable water in the UK is produced from naturally occurring fresh water by:choosing an appropriate source of fresh waterpassing the water through filter beds to remove insoluble particlessterilising the water to kill microbesThe methods used for sterilisation include chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet light.",Water,Water,The atmosphere,Water
129,Desalination,"Potable water can be made from sea water, through a process known as desalination. It is preferable to make potable water from fresh water reserves rather than from sea water. This is because removing the large amount of salt (35 grams in every kilogram of sea water) requires a lot of energy.Desalination can be done by distillation and by reverse osmosis.DistillationSea water is heated until it boils. The salt remains in the liquid, and the steam is pure water. The steam is cooled and condensed to make potable water. Distillation requires a lot of energy to boil the water, and also to cool the steam down to condense it. The waste water is very salty and can be difficult to dispose of in a sustainable way which does not harm marine ecosystems.Reverse osmosisWater is put under high pressure and passed through a membrane which has tiny pores (holes) in it. The pores allow water molecules through, but prevent most ions and molecules from passing through. Reverse osmosis requires expensive membranes and also produces a large volume of waste water, so its efficiency is often quite low.QuestionWhich method of water purification would be best suited to a country in the Middle East which has a large amount of fossil fuel reserves? Reveal answerupdownDistillation would be the most appropriate method of desalination because the country would be able to use fossil fuels to provide the energy needed to boil and condense the water at a relatively low cost.",Water,Water,Water,Water
130,Waste water treatment,"Waste water from homes, industry and agriculture must be treated before being released into the environment. Here are some examples of pollutants which might be present in waste water:sewage contains organic matter and harmful bacteriaindustrial waste water may contain organic matter and harmful chemicals such as toxic metal compoundsagricultural waste water may contain fertilisers or pesticides which can disrupt sensitive ecosystemsSewage treatment involves the following steps:Screening and grit removal to remove large particles.Sedimentation allows tiny particles to settle out from still water, which produces sewage sludge and effluent (the liquid which remains on top).The effluent enters an aeration tank, where oxygen is pumped into the water. Here aerobic bacteria break down the remaining waste. The sewage sludge is digested anaerobically by bacteria. It can be recycled to be used as a fertiliser on farms.",Water,Water,Water,Water

Record your observations carefully.For each sample of water, pour 50 cm3 into a clean pre-weighed evaporating basin. Heat gently over a Bunsen burner, tripod and gauze until no liquid remains. Allow to cool, then weigh the evaporating basin again and calculate the mass of solid that remains in the evaporating basin.Analysis _ Part 1 (Analysing water samples) Water sample pHMass of solid obtained by evaporating 50 cm3 of water sample (g) A 70.00B81.74C40.07QuestionWhich sample was sea water?Reveal answerupdownSample B was sea water.

This is for safety reasons. Describe what would happen if you stopped heating the sea water and the end of the delivery tube was below the surface of the distillate.Reveal answerupdownAs the delivery tube cools the distillate will be sucked up the delivery tube. When this cool water reaches the hot glass, it may cause the glass to break.Hazards, risks and precautions It is important to evaluate the hazards and the precautions needed to reduce the risk of harm.

132,Levels of organisation,"An ecosystem is the living organisms in a particular area together with the non-living components of the environment, such as soil, air and water.A habitat is a place where organisms live in an ecosystem. A community is the populations of organisms that live in an ecosystem.There is a close interaction between the organisms and the non-living components of an ecosystem.Producers and consumersFood chains show what organisms eat, or what organisms are eaten by others  - in other words, the feeding relationships of organisms - in an ecosystem.A simple example of a food chain is:grass _ rabbits _ foxesAt the base of almost every food chain is a producer. These are plants or algae, which photosynthesise. This means they convert energy from the Sun into glucose during photosynthesis producing biomass. It is this which feeds, and provides energy to the rest of the food chain.All animals that follow the producer in the food chain are called consumers. The first is the primary consumer, which has fed on the producer. The next is the secondary consumer, which has eaten animals that fed on the producer. Secondary consumers may be eaten by tertiary consumers.Animals that hunt and kill others are called predators, and those that are hunted and killed are called prey.In reality, many animals eat more than one type of organism, and food chains combine to make food webs.DecomposersDecomposers are organisms that breakdown dead organisms in a process called decomposition or rotting.  They include bacteria and fungi. Decomposers release enzymes onto the dead matter and afterwards, consume the broken down substances. They form a vital role in the recycling of matter. When organisms die and decompose, plants absorb the broken down nutrients through their roots.",Ecosystems and biodiversity,Transport into and out of cells,Ecosystems and biodiversity,Ecosystems and biodiversity
133,Predator-prey cycles,"In a healthy, balanced ecosystem the numbers of predators and prey remain fairly constant. They can go up and down during each year, but generally over the years, these increases and decreases remain fairly constant.If numbers of either predators or prey increase or decrease, it could be due to a change in the abiotic factors, like water or sunlight, or biotic factors, like a new predator or pathogen. This would result in a less balanced ecosystem.An example is shown in the graph below and shows characteristic repeating patterns called predator-prey cycles.The graph shows that there is almost always more prey than predators. It also shows the following patterns:The number of predators increases because there is more prey.The number of prey then reduces because there are more predators.The number of predators then reduces because there is now less prey.",Ecosystems and biodiversity,Combined Science,Forces,Explaining change

If the populations of one organism rises or falls, then this can affect the rest of the ecosystem.Within a community, each species depends on other species, for instance for:foodsheltersuccessful pollinationsuccessful seed dispersalThe most common interdependence is for food. For example, in the simple food chain:grass _ rabbit _ fox If the foxes in this food chain were killed, the population of rabbits would increase because they are no longer prey to the foxes. As a result, the amount of grass would decrease because the increased population of rabbits would be eating it. Very small changes to ecosystems have large consequences, which can be difficult to predict. This means that all the organisms in an ecosystem are dependent upon each other. We call this interdependence.A stable community is one in which the size of the populations of all species remain relatively constant over time.  In the example above, the amount of grass, and the numbers of rabbits and foxes would all remain relatively constant. The different populations are living in a healthy balance within their environment.CompetitionOften, the organisms within an ecosystem compete for resources.Competition can be interspecific or intraspecific depending on whether organisms from different species or the same species are competing for these resources.Competition in plantsPlants compete for:light, which is necessary for photosynthesisspace, avoiding shading so the plant can get maximum light for photosynthesiswater from the soil, which is necessary as a solvent for chemical reactions and for photosynthesisminerals from the soil, so that the plant can form other products from the glucose produced by photosynthesisCompetition in animalsAnimals might compete for:fooda mate, so they can pass on their genes to offspringterritory - an animal may defend the territory where it livesCompetition creates a 'struggle for existence'. Individuals within a species that cannot compete effectively are unlikely to reproduce, and may die. This can be referred to as 'survival of the fittest' and  is a driver for evolution. Species that are unable to effectively compete may become extinct.",Ecosystems and biodiversity,Transport into and out of cells,Ecosystems and biodiversity,Explaining change
135,Abiotic factors that affect communities,"The abundance of organisms in an ecosystem and their distribution is affected by abiotic factors. These are factors that are non-living.They include:light intensity:

137,Field investigations,"It is important for ecologists to estimate the number of organisms in a population to:better understand the relationships in a communityhelp to  monitor the impact changing environmental conditions, eg climate change or conservation projects that aim to conserve endangered species or habitatsIt is almost always impossible to count all of the organisms in a population. So a small section of a population can be looked at to estimate distribution or numbers in the whole population.This process requires sampling and the area or part of population looked at is called a sample.SamplingWhen sampling a population:the numbers of organisms are counted within a sample site, and then the results multiplied to estimate the total number in the entire habitatlarge animals and plants can often simply be counted, sometimes from an aerial photographsmaller animals such as insects and smaller mammals need to be trapped first so they can be counted and then released afterwards - pitfall traps are small traps dug into the ground, which often have food inside to attract small mammals and the sides of these traps are smooth to stop the mammals escapinginsects and other invertebrates can be collected and counted using large nets to sweep through grasses or leaves of trees in a process called sweep nettingaquatic organisms can be collected and counted using nets held downstream of an area of river bed which is then gently disturbed by the person doing the sampling - the small animals float into the net, and this is called kick-samplingpooters are small devices used when sampling to suck up small insects safely without them going into your mouthUsing quadratsQuadrats, are square frames of wire, often with an area of 0.25 m2. These are placed on the sampling area - for instance, the ground, a rockpool or tree trunk - to estimate the distribution of plants or slow-moving animals within them.When investigating plants in quadrats, the following sampling techniques can be used:Number of an individual species: the total number of individuals of one species (eg daisies) is recorded.Species richness: the number of different plant or animal species is recorded but not the number of individuals within a species.Percentage cover: the percentage of the quadrat area that is covered by one species (eg grass). This is easier to estimate if a quadrat has wires making smaller sections. Percentage cover rather than number of individuals is used when estimating plant frequencies if it is difficult to identify individual plants, such as grasses,  moss or seaweeds on rocks.Random or systematic sampling?Random sampling using a quadrat involves the placing of quadrats at random coordinates.Regardless of whether you are investigating the number of individual species, the species diversity or the percentage cover in different areas you would normally use random sampling.Systematic sampling uses a line called a transect, sampling at regular intervals along it, often using a quadrat. Transects are used where the habitat is not uniform and may show different zones.curriculum-key-factMost sampling is random.Systematic sampling can be used if there is a trend or pattern across the habitat, such as distance up a beach, or altitude on a hillside.If you are using the wrong kind of sampling method for your experiment, this can lead to biased results.",Ecosystems and biodiversity,Plant diseases,Cells in animals and plants,Ecosystems and biodiversity

139,Biodiversity,"Areas like tropical rainforests have millions of different species and are very biodiverse. Other areas like the polar regions have far fewer species and are less biodiverse.Biodiversity is specifically the number of different species. Biodiversity is greater in ecosystems that provide a bigger range of different habitats, which are home to larger populations of a variety of organisms. An area with large populations of few species is not biodiverse.If the numbers of one species are affected, there are almost always knock-on consequences. A simple food chain is: algae _ zooplankton _ sand eel _ puffin _  arctic skuaIf the numbers of zooplankton are reduced by pollution, such as plastic waste, then more algae will grow and the population of other consumers will fall.Ecosystems with higher biodiversity have fewer species that depend on just one other for food, shelter and maintaining their environment. The example above is part of a wider food web. The puffins could also eat molluscs and worms. Ecosystems with higher biodiversity are more stable as they can easily adjust to changes.We are slowly realising that the future of our species on Earth depends on maintaining high biodiversity. Ecosystems with high levels of biodiversity help to provide the resources needed to sustain life, including human life. Activities that create air and water pollution are reducing biodiversity in many ecosystems.Conservation of species and habitats by charities, governments and individuals helps to maintain the range of biodiversity.",Ecosystems and biodiversity,The digestive system,Ecosystems and biodiversity,Ecosystems and biodiversity
140,Negative human impacts,"As the human population increases, the volume of waste and pollution that is produced also increases. Polluting an ecosystem harms or kills the organisms that live within it.In modern society, humans manufacture an increasing number of products and replace them more often. This is not  sustainable - many natural materials, including fossil fuels, will soon run out and many people argue that there is already too much waste.Water pollutionIn some instances, toxic waste or sewage can end up in, or be discharged into streams, rivers and lakes, causing damage to aquatic life and serious illness in humans that may drink the contaminated water.Some farmers use too many fertilisers, which can run off fields during heavy rain. This can pollute nearby streams and rivers leading to eutrophication.Air pollutionCombustion of fossil fuels and other fuels releases carbon dioxide. This contributes to the greenhouse effect, producing global warming and leading to climate change.Combustion of fossil fuels also releases sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides which can cause acid rain. Air pollution can also be caused by tiny particulates from smoke which can cause smog. Some of the world's major cities like Delhi in India and Karachi in Pakistan have dangerously high levels of air pollution.Land pollutionThe rubbish we throw out that is not recycled goes into a land fill. These are huge holes in the ground into which our rubbish is dumped. Some things like batteries cannot be put into landfill sites because of the toxic chemicals they contain. They must be recycled. Other land pollution comes when some people dump rubbish in public or other private places, often to avoid paying for it to be disposed of. This is called fly tipping and is illegal.Land useThe larger the human population gets, the more land we require. More houses must be built, more resources found, more food must be grown and more waste is produced. This often means less space and fewer resources for other animals and plants. Biodiversity is significantly reduced when land is cleared for human uses, such as building, quarrying, farming and waste disposal. A reduction in biodiversity occurs when an area of rainforest is cut down to grow crops.DeforestationFor thousands of years, humans have been deforesting small areas of woodland to build their own houses or grow crops to feed their families. However, in recent years the increase in the human population and development of industrial machinery has meant that much larger areas have been cleared. This is often by large companies who deforest to provide land for cattle, rice fields growing crops for food and biofuels.curriculum-key-fact In the last 75 years,  over half of the world's rainforests have been cut down. Scientists estimate that 32,000 hectares of rainforest are destroyed each day.Deforestation destroys the habitats of the organisms that live there and through this kills individuals of many species. Scientists estimate that several hundred species of plant, animal and insect are lost each day partly as a result of deforestation. This means that deforestation is causing extinctions and dramatically reducing biodiversity.Peat bog destructionBogs are very wet areas of land without trees in which many types of moss grow. They are acidic and often have very low levels of nutrients. Here decomposition is very slow and peat is formed from partially decayed plants.For many years peat was removed from bogs for gardeners to add to their soil or in some countries, to burn as fuel.  This dramatically reduced biodiversity. Because peat takes such a long time to form, it is a non-renewable energy resource like fossil fuels.Peat bogs are a very important store of carbon. We call them carbon sinks. If all the peat was removed and burned this would quickly release a huge volume of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and contribute to the greenhouse effect.The greenhouse effectWithout the greenhouse effect, it is estimated that the mean temperature on Earth would be -18°C and there would be very little or no life. So the greenhouse effect itself is a good thing. The greenhouse effect traps some of the energy from the Sun, which keeps our planet at a suitable temperature for life.The problem is that the increased release of greenhouse gases is causing an increase in the greenhouse effect called the enhanced greenhouse effect.Carbon dioxide, water vapour and methane are amongst the most common greenhouse gases. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, in about 1750, the levels of carbon dioxide have increased by 40%.Global warmingGlobal warming is the increase in the mean temperature of the Earth. The ten hottest years since records began have been in the last 30 years. The mean increase in the last 100 years has been less than 1°C. This might seem small, but is enough to have devastating consequences on many species in different parts of the world.As the percentage of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere has increased, so has the Earth's mean temperature.Note that the shape of the first graph showing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is 'exponential' and is a similar shape to graphs showing human population change over the same time period.When comparing graphs such as changes to carbon dioxide levels and temperature against time, note that the axes are drawn to different scales, and do not start at '0'.The consequences of global warming and climate change are:melting of the polar ice capsthe rise in sea level that will flood many parts of the world and may one day threaten many cities such as London, New York and Amsterdamweather patterns will change with more unusual weather:
               long-term, in the UK, summers are expected to become hotter and drier, and while plant productivity will increase, some native species of tree in our woodlands may struggle to survive the warmer conditionsanimals will migrate towards the poles to find habitats with suitable temperatures:
                in the UK, we are already seeing some species, eg of butterfly, moving northwards, while numbers of some northern species are decreasing because of the warmer conditionstropical diseases may become more common in other regions, such as Europemany species will become extinct",Ecosystems and biodiversity,The atmosphere,The atmosphere,Ecosystems and biodiversity
141,Positive human impacts,"The increase in the human population and waste it produces, deforestation, peat bog destruction and global warming are all reducing biodiversity.Conservation helps to stabilise or reverse the negative effects that human populations have on ecosystems. Conservation is the preservation of the natural environment, ecosystems and species.Scientists and concerned members of the public help maintain biodiversity by:breeding programmes to help to preserve endangered species, such as species of rhino and the giant pandaprotection of endangered habitats and regeneration of habitats on a local, regional or national levelreplanting hedgerows and creating borders around fields of crops - 'skylark strips' - because there is higher biodiversity in them than the fields of crops they surroundreducing deforestation - deforestation reduces the potential to store carbon and burning timber waste releases  greenhouse gasesrecycling rather than dumping waste in landfill sitesNicola Hallot from Knowsley Safari Park talks about the endangered animals at Knowsley including Père David's deer, Bactrian camel and scimitar-horned oryx.

142,Chromosomes and genes,"DNAThe genetic material in the nucleus of a cell is composed of a chemical called DNA. DNA is a polymer, a large and complex molecule. It is made up of two strands forming a twisted ladder structure called a double helix. DNA is contained in structures called 
   chromosomes.DNA carries the genetic code, which determines all the characteristics of a living organism. Except for identical twins, each person's DNA is unique.The structure  of DNA. The letters represent the genetic codeGenesA gene is a small section of DNA in a chromosome. Each gene carries the code for a particular sequence of amino acids required to assemble a specific protein.A gene is the unit of heredity, and may be copied and passed on to the next generation.The diagram shows the relationship between the cell, its nucleus, chromosomes in the nucleus, and genes.ChromosomesThe cell's nucleus contains chromosomes. These are long threads of DNA, which are made up of many genes. Humans have around 25,000 genes across their 23 pairs of chromosomes.GenomeThe genome of an organism is the entire genetic material of that organism. The sequence of letters in the human genome has been determined, but research is still ongoing. Understanding the human genome has great importance for medicine.",Inheritance,Inheritance,Inheritance,Inheritance
143,Sex determination in humans,"Sexual reproductionTwo parents are needed in sexual reproduction.During this process the nuclei of the male and female sex cells, called gametes, fuse to create a zygote. This process is known as fertilisation.Each gamete contains half the number of chromosomes and is described as haploid.When the male and female gametes combine, they restore the full complement of chromosomes - or diploid number - to produce a human embryo.The gametes in animals are sperm and eggs.The gametes in flowering plants are pollen and eggs.The offspring produced in sexual reproduction are genetically different to each other and the parents. This process results in variation as it involves the mixing of genetic information.Humans can only reproduce sexually.The advantages of sexual reproduction are:it produces variation in the offspringthe species can adapt to new environments due to variation, which gives them a survival advantagea disease is less likely to affect all the individuals in a populationhumans can speed up natural selection through selective breeding, which can increase food productionSexual reproduction - conceptionSex determination in humansHuman body cells have 23 pairs of chromosomes in the nucleus.22 pairs are known as autosomes, and control characteristics only, but one pair carries genes that determine sex - whether offspring are male or female:males have two different sex chromosomes, X and  Y, and are described as XYfemales have two X chromosomes, and are described as XXChromosomes from a maleThese diagrams are known as human karyotypes, and show all the chromosomes, cut out from a micrograph and aligned in pairs.The blue box shows the two sex chromosomes - these are different sizes, and are an X (larger chromosome) and a Y (smaller one).Chromosomes from a femaleThe red box shows the two sex chromosomes - these are the same size, both two X, larger chromosomes.Genetic diagramA genetic diagram, like a Punnett square, shows how biological sex is inherited.The mother's/female chromosomes - XX and the father's/male chromosomes - XYThe two possible combinations are:an X chromosome from the mother and an X chromosome from the father - producing a girl (XX)an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father - producing a boy (XY)The ratio of female to male offspring is 1:1, ie half of the offspring will be girls and half will be boys ie on average. This can also be converted into a probability of 50% (XX) and 50% (XY).",Inheritance,Cell division,Cell division,Inheritance
144,Single gene inheritance,"A short video explaining gene inheritance and demonstrating how to use a punnett squareSome characteristics are controlled by a single gene, such as fur colour in mice and red-green colour blindness in humans.Genes might have different forms, and these are called alleles.Chromosomes are found in the nucleus of a body cell in pairs. One chromosome is inherited from the mother and one is inherited from the father. The chromosomes in each pair carry the same genes in the same location. These genes could be the same, or different versions.Alleles are different versions of the same gene.For any gene, a person may have the same two alleles, and is described as homozygous, or two different alleles and is described as heterozygous.For example, for this gene, with two different alleles, shown as green and red, three combinations are possible:The genotype of an organism is its genetic description and is based on the collection of alleles that it has.The genotype is expressed as a phenotype - these are the characteristics that we see.In the heterozygous individual, A, if the allele that enables the person to produce the pigment in brown eyes is present, it does not matter what the second allele is - the person will be able to produce the pigment, and will therefore have brown eyes.Alleles may be either dominant or recessive:A dominant allele is always expressed, even if only one copy is present. Dominant alleles are represented by a capital letter, for example, A.The allele for brown eyes is dominant. Only one copy of this allele is needed for a person to have brown eyes. Two copies will still give brown eyes.A recessive allele is only expressed if the individual has two copies and does not have the dominant allele of that gene. Recessive alleles are represented by a lower case letter, for example, a.The allele for blue eyes is recessive. Two copies of this allele is needed for a person to have blue eyes.In a homozygous individual, both alleles are identical for the same characteristic, for example AA or aa.In a heterozygous individual, the alleles for the same characteristic will be different, for example Aa.Most characteristics, including eye colour, are controlled by more than a single gene.",Inheritance,Inheritance,Inheritance,Inheritance
145,Carrying out a genetic cross,"Monohybrid crossesGenetic crosses involving single genes (monohybrid inheritance) can be shown and examined using Punnett squares.This shows the possible offspring combinations that could be produced. The probability of these combinations can be calculated.Worked example 1The height of pea plants is controlled by a single gene which has two alleles: tall and short.The tall allele is dominant and is shown as T.The small allele is recessive and is shown as t.Complete a Punnett square like the one shown below to show the possible allele combinations of the offspring produced when two pea plants are bred.Genotype of female = TTPhenotype of female = tallGenotype of male = ttPhenotype of male - shortTTtTtTttTtTtYou see that all the possible offspring have the same genotype - Tt.Note: You should always write the dominant allele first.This means that all the offspring produced will be tall.Worked example 2In this genetic cross:the genotype of the female is Ddthe genotype of the male is  ddDddDddddDdddHalf of the possible offspring have the genotype Dd and the other half have the genotype dd.These examples are single gene combinations, but remember that most phenotypes are controlled by multiple genes.Maths - use probability, direct proportion and simple ratios - HigherYou should be able to express the outcome of a genetic cross using probability, direct proportion or ratios.Worked example 3In this genetic cross:the genotype of the female is Aathe genotype of the male is aaAaaAaaaaAaaaDirect proportionHalf the offspring have the combination Aa and half have aa.or:Out of four offspring, two have the combination Aa and two have aa.ProbabilityThe probability of the offspring being Aa is 50%.The probability of the offspring being aa is 50%.RatioThe ratio of Aa to aa is 1:1.It is important to remember that during the process of fertilisation, the allele combinations are created in a random process, which is why probability is used, as nothing is guaranteed.Each of the four possible offspring combinations is as likely to happen during every fertilisation event.Worked example 4The inheritance of fur colour in mice is controlled by a single gene. White fur is recessive. Grey fur is dominant. Two mice that are heterozygous for the fur colour gene mate.Determine the probability that the offspring will have grey fur.Step 1:Female: AaMale: AaStep 2:AaAaStep 3:AaAAAAaaAaaaThere is a 75% probability of the offspring having grey fur, and a 25% probability that offspring will have white fur.The expected ratio of the offspring will be 3:1, grey fur to white fur.",Inheritance,Inheritance,Inheritance,Inheritance

147,Family trees,"The genome of an organism is the entire genetic material of that organism. The sequence of letters in the human genome has been determined, but research is still ongoing. Understanding the human genome has great importance for medicine.Research on the human genome enables us to:search for genes linked to different types of diseaseunderstand inherited disorders and devise treatmentstrace human migration patterns from the pastScientists are searching for disease associated genes. One example is the genes that can contribute to breast cancer, which are known as BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in these genes account for approximately 10% of all inherited breast cancer cases detected.Scientists detected BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes by studying individuals in families known to have inherited breast cancer. They were able to create a pedigree analysis, which is similar to a family tree diagram, that showed the close relationship of those affected and unaffected within the family.The pedigree analysis illustrates the inheritance pattern of the disease.In the pedigree analysis chart below, males are indicated by the square shape and females are represented by circles. Affected individuals are red and unaffected are blue. Horizontal lines between males and females show that they have produced children.This analysis shows both males and females are affected, and every generation has affected individuals. There is one family group that has no affected parents or children, but the remaining two families have one affected parent and affected children too.",Inheritance,Inheritance,Cell division,Inheritance
148,Variation,"Individuals in a population are usually similar to each other, but not identical. Some of this variation within a species is genetic, some is environmental - the conditions in which they have developed and some is a combination of both.The genotype is the collection of alleles that determine characteristics and can be expressed as a phenotype. Most phenotypic features are the result of multiple genes rather than single gene inheritance.Genetic causes of variationChildren generally look a little like their mother and their father, but are not identical to either. They inherit their features from each parent's DNA.Every sperm and egg cell contains half of the genetic information needed for an individual. Each sex cell is described as haploid, and has half the normal number of chromosomes. When the chromosomes fuse during fertilisation, a new cell is formed, which is known as a zygote. It has all the genetic information needed for an individual, and is described as diploid. It has the full number of chromosomes.Examples of genetic variation in humans include:blood groupskin colournatural eye colourWhether you have lobed or lobeless ears is due to genetic causes.Environmental causes of variationCharacteristics of animal and plant species can be affected by factors such as climate, diet, accidents, culture and lifestyle. For example, if you eat too much you will become heavier, and if you eat too little you will become lighter. A plant in the shade of a big tree will grow taller to reach more light.Other examples of features that show environmental variation include:scarslanguage and accentflower colour in hydrangeas as these plants produce blue flowers in acidic soil and pink flowers in alkaline soilGenetic and environmental causes togetherSome features vary because of a combination of genetic and environmental causes. For example, tall parents will pass genes to their children for height. Their children have the genetic potential to also be tall. However, if their diet is poor then they will not grow very well - their environment also has an effect on their height.",Inheritance,Inheritance,Cell division,Inheritance
149,Mutations,"A mutation is a change in a gene or chromosome.Mutations occur continuously and are often random changes in the genetic material that can be inherited. There is extensive genetic variation within a population caused by mutations.Causes of mutationMutation occurs continuously and can be spontaneous. It can also happen:when cells are copying themselves during mitosis (cell division)if a person comes into contact with environmental factors such ionising radiationbecause of chemical mutagens - such as tar from cigarette smokeMutations may change the activity of a protein, in a coding part of the DNA, or might change how the genes are expressed if the change is in a non-coding section of DNA. These might result in phenotype changes or they might appear hidden, and be unnoticed. Alternatively, they might result in a serious consequence, such as genetic disease such as cystic fibrosis.",Evolution,Inheritance,Inheritance,Inheritance
150,Evolution through natural selection,"The idea behind the theory of evolution through the process of natural selection is that all species of living things have evolved from simple life forms over a period of time.

The key points are:Individuals in a species show a wide range of variation and this variation is because of differences in their genes.Animals will compete for food and water, and for a mate, and plants for light, water, minerals and space, creating a struggle for existence.Individuals with characteristics most suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce. This is commonly known as 'survival of the fittest'.The genes that allow these individuals to be successful within their environment are passed on to their offspring, which results in these specific genes becoming more common.Those that are poorly adapted to their environment are less likely to survive and reproduce. Their genes are less likely to be passed on to the next generation.Over a period of time, a species will gradually change or evolve.Both genes and the environment can cause variation, but only genetic variation can be passed on to the next generation.If two populations of one species become increasingly different in phenotype so that they can no longer interbreed to form fertile offspring, this can result in the formation of two species.A simple example of a struggle for existence and natural selection can be seen in peacocks:females choose a mate based on their colourful tail feathersthe more colourful the tail of a peacock, the more likely they are to mate and pass on these genesover time, the tails of peacocks have become more colourful",Evolution,Evolution,Evolution,Plant diseases
151,Charles Darwin,"Charles DarwinCharles Darwin was an English naturalist who studied variation in plants, animals and fossils during a five-year voyage around the world in the 19th century. Darwin visited four continents on the ship HMS Beagle.Darwin observed many organisms including giant tortoises, mocking birds, finches and other unusual animals during his five week visit to the  Galapágos Islands, off the coast of Ecuador in the Pacific Ocean. He continued to work and develop his ideas for many years after he returned from his voyages.Finally, as a result of Darwin's world expedition and observations, which were backed by many years of experimentation, his discussions with like-minded scientists and his developing knowledge of geology and fossils, he proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection.Darwin proposed that:individual organisms within a particular species show a wide range of variation for a characteristicindividuals with characteristics most suited to the environment are more likely to survive to breed successfullythe characteristics that have enabled these individuals to survive are then passed on to the next generationThis theory is called natural selection.Darwin's ideas were documented in the book On the Origin of Species, which was published in 1859. The naturalist's ideas created controversy in Victorian society.Darwin's theory of evolution challenged the idea that God made all the animals and plants that live on Earth, which contradicted the commonly held Christian views of his era. He did not publish his scientific work and ideas until 28 years after his voyage.The theory of evolution through the process of natural selection was only gradually accepted because:the theory challenged the idea that God made all animals and plants that live on Earth (creationism)there was insufficient evidence when the theory was published to convince many scientiststhe mechanism of inheritance and variation was not known until 50 years after the theory was publishedSome scientists were reluctant to change their minds about the ideas of creationism, even when new evidence was discovered that contradicted their ideas.Darwin's book, On the Origin of Species, was a world best-seller and is still in print today. With every new edition of his book, more evidence was discovered to support Darwin's ideas. This led to the development of his theory over time.",Evolution,Evolution,Evolution,Evolution
152,Evidence for evolution - fossils,"A fossil is the preserved remains of a dead organism from millions of years ago. Fossils are found in rocks and can be formed from:Hard body parts, such as bones and shells, which do not decay easily or are replaced by minerals as they decay.Parts of organisms that have not decayed because one or more of the conditions needed for decay are absent. For example, dead animals and plants can be preserved in amber, peat bogs, tar pits, or in ice.Preserved traces of organisms, such as footprints, burrows and rootlet traces - these become covered by layers of sediment, which eventually become rock.Ammonite fossils are sea creatures that became extinct about 65 million years agoThe fossil recordFossil remains have been found in rocks of all ages. Fossils of the simplest organisms are found in the oldest rocks, and fossils of more complex organisms in the newest rocks. This supports Darwin's theory of evolution, which states that simple life forms gradually evolved into more complex ones.Evidence for early forms of life comes from fossils. By studying fossils, scientists can learn how much (or how little) organisms have changed as life developed on Earth.There are gaps in the fossil record because many early forms of life were soft-bodied, which means that they have left few traces behind. What traces there were may have been destroyed by geological activity. This is why scientists cannot be certain about how life began.Fossils provide a snapshot of the past and allow us to study how much or how little organisms have changed as life developed on Earth.Evolutionary treesEvolutionary trees are used to represent the relationships between organisms. Branches show places where new species have been formed by evolution.In this evolutionary tree, species A and B share a recent common ancestor. Species A is therefore most similar to species B.Species F and G also share a recent, yet different, common ancestor, which itself shared a common ancestor with species E. All seven species share a common ancestor, probably from the distant past. The information is collected from a variety of sources such as fossil records to DNA sequences.Ice and peat fossilsUnder certain conditions, fossils might not have been created. Parts of organisms do not always decay because the conditions needed might be absent and so they may be preserved in different ways. For example, dead animals and plants can be preserved in amber, peat bogs, tar pits, or in ice instead.",Evolution,Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells,Explaining change
153,Evidence for evolution - resistant bacteria,"Antibiotic resistanceBacteria can evolve quickly because they reproduce at a fast rate. Mutations of bacteria can produce new strains. Some bacteria might become resistant to certain antibiotics, such as penicillin, and cannot be destroyed by the antibiotic. The evolution of the bacteria is an example of natural selection.Development of resistanceThe main steps in the development of resistance are:random mutations occur in the genes of individual bacterial cellssome mutations protect the bacterial cell from the effects of the antibioticbacteria without the mutation die or cannot reproduce when the antibiotic is presentresistant bacteria can reproduce with less competition from normal bacterial strainsMRSAThe number of resistant strains has increased, partly due to the misuse of antibiotics. This has resulted in more infections that are difficult to control.MRSA is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and it is very dangerous because it is resistant to most antibiotics.In order to reduce the rate of development of antibiotic resistant strains:doctors should not prescribe antibiotics inappropriately, such as for the treatment of non-serious infectionspatients should always complete the full course of antibiotics to ensure all bacteria are killed and none survive to mutate and form resistant strainsthe agricultural use of antibiotics should be restrictedPenicillin was the first antibiotic to be produced on a mass scale in the 1940s. It is derived from Penicillium fungus, shown here growing on an agar plate.Some antibiotics are kept in reserve as a last resort _ when others fail. But some bacteria are now becoming resistant to these.The development of new antibiotics has slowed in recent years. Drugs companies have little financial incentive to develop antibiotics that would only be used very occasionally if none of the other types worked.Antibiotic development has now increased again, however, as governments realise that this will be required to avert a global catastrophe. Drugs companies are also adopting new strategies to kill bacteria - one approach might make bacteria suicidal. Researchers are also investigating the genomes of pathogens and researching genomic approaches to fighting disease.",Evolution,Lifestyle and health,"Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Plant diseases
154,Classification,"Linnaean system of classificationLiving organisms are classified into groups depending on their structure and characteristics. This system was developed in the eighteenth century by Carl Linnaeus.The classification of species allows the subdivision of living organisms into smaller and more specialised groups.KingdomsThe first division of living things in the classification system is to put them into one of five kingdoms.The five kingdoms are:animals (all multicellular animals)plants (all green plants)fungi (moulds, mushrooms, yeast)protists (Amoeba, Chlorella and Plasmodium)prokaryotes (bacteria, blue-green algae)Further divisionsKingdoms can be divided into smaller groups, ranked below in order of size:phylumclassorderfamilygenusspeciesAs an example, the complete breakdown of the classification of lions:kingdom - Animalia (animal)phylum - Chordata (vertebrate)class - Mammalia (mammal)order - Carnivora (carnivore)family - Felidae (cat)genus - Panthera (big cat)species - leo (lion)Note that genus is given an upper case letter, the species, lower. Biologists write the genus and species names in italics or underline them.The genus, Panthera, also has four other living species:Panthera onca - the jaguarPanthera pardus - the leopardPanthera tigris - the tigerPanthea uncia - the snow leopardThere are many ways to remember Linnaeus' system of classification, for example using the mnemonic:Kids prefer candy over fresh green saladErithacus rubecula, the European RobinThe binomial system of naming species uses Latin words. Each name has two parts, the genus and the species. For example, human beings belong to the genus Homo, and our species is sapiens - so the scientific name is Homo sapiens.The binomial system is important because it allows scientists to accurately identify individual species. Common names, or local names for species can cause confusion. For example, in Europe, the  'robin' is Erithacus rubecula. It is much smaller than the bird called the 'robin' in America, which is Turdus migratorius, and belongs to a different genus.The grouping of families was added to allow the large number of new species to be included in this system. Linnaeus' original ideas have been adapted, but continued to be accepted and as new species are identified they can be fitted into the current classification system.As more scientific equipment, such as powerful microscopes, became available, scientists were able to examine organisms in more detail and note important features that could be used to group them or separate them.  An increase in our knowledge and understanding of evolution has also helped to improve the classification of organisms.Today, DNA analysis has led to improvements in classification and an increased understanding of evolutionary relationships.",Evolution,Combined Science,Plant diseases,Plant diseases
155,Selective breeding,"Selective breeding or artificial selection is when humans breed plants and animals to obtain desirable characteristics.Humans have bred food crops from wild plants and domesticated animals for thousands of years.Different crops have been developed from the wild plant, Brassica oleracea. All of these crops belong to the same species.Main steps involvedSelective breeding takes place over many generations. These are the main steps for both plants and animals:Decide which characteristics are important enough to select.Choose parents that show these characteristics from a mixed population.Breed these parents. Choose the best offspring, with the desired characteristics, to produce the next generation.Repeat the process continuously over many generations, until all offspring show the desired characteristics.Farmers selectively breed different types of cows with highly desirable characteristics in order to produce the best meat and dairy.previousnextpreviousnextHighland cows have been bred for their meatpreviousnextFriesian cows have been bred to produce large volumes of milkpreviousnextAberdeen Angus cows have also been bred for their meatCharacteristics can be chosen for usefulness or appearance:Desired characteristics in plants:disease resistance in food cropscrops that produce high yieldscolourful, large or unusual flowersDesired characteristics in animals:animals that produce lots of milk or meatchickens that lay large eggsdomestic dogs that have a gentle natureThe new varieties may be economically important. For example, they may provide more or better quality food.Benefits and risks of selective breedingBecause of selective breeding, future generations of selectively bred plants and animals will all share very similar genes which will reduce variation. Genes and their different alleles within a population are known as its gene pool.Inbreeding can lead to a reduced gene pool, making it more difficult to produce new varieties in the future. This also makes organisms prone to certain diseases or inherited defects.Benefits of selective breeding:new varieties may be economically important by producing more or better quality foodanimals can be selected that cannot cause harm, eg cattle without hornsRisks of selective breeding:reduced genetic variation can lead to attack by specific insects or disease, which could be extremely destructiverare disease genes can be unknowingly selected as part of a positive trait, leading to problems with specific organisms, eg a high percentage of Dalmatian dogs are deafcan create physical problems in specific organisms, eg some breeds of dogs can have hip dysplasia due to hips not being formed correctly",Evolution,Cell division,Plant diseases,Inheritance
156,Genetic engineering,"Genetic engineering is also called genetic modification or GM. It involves modifying the genome of an organism by introducing a gene from another organism to result in a desired characteristic.Genetic engineering involves these steps:selection of the desired characteristicthe gene responsible for the characteristic is 'cut out' of the chromosomethe gene is transferred and inserted into another organismreplication of the modified organismPlant crops have been genetically engineered to be disease resistant or to produce bigger fruits.Current uses of genetic engineeringType 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the body's pancreas does not produce enough insulin. The affected person cannot control their blood glucose levels.Type 1 diabetes can be controlled by injecting insulin. The extra insulin allows the glucose to be taken up by the liver and other tissues, which results in cells receiving the glucose they need, and blood glucose levels staying normal.Previously, insulin was extracted from the pancreas of pigs or cattle, but these do not have an identical composition to human insulin. Bacterial cells have been genetically modified - by inserting the human gene for insulin production into their plasmids - so that the bacteria produce human insulin.Current genetically engineered crops include those that are resistant to insect attack or are herbicide resistant. This results in increased yields. Herbicide resistant crops allow them to tolerate herbicides sprayed on them, but weeds, which would otherwise compete with the crops are killed by it.Scientists have recently added a gene to bananas - from a species of banana found in Papua New Guinea - that makes them produce  beta carotene. This changes the colour of the flesh of the bananas to a golden-yellow colour. Beta carotene is needed by humans in order to make vitamin A, which is essential for good vision.The advantage of golden bananas is that they could be grown and used to feed people in areas where vitamin A deficiency is common, so the bananas could help prevent blindness, and the death of many people.Sheep and goats have been genetically engineered to produce chemicals in their milk that can be used to treat disease. In one example, the milk produced contains a protein needed to treat patients with cystic fibrosis.Research is also exploring the possibility of providing tissues needed for transplants from animals that have been genetically engineered so that the tissues are not rejected by the human immune system.In the future, researchers are hoping to use genetic engineering to be able to overcome some inherited disorders, such as cystic fibrosis and Huntington's disease amongst others.Potential benefits and risks of genetic engineeringBenefits of genetic engineeringGenetic modification is a faster and more efficient way of getting the same results as selective breeding.Improves crop yields or crop quality, which are particularly important in developing countries. This may help reduce hunger around the world.Introduce herbicide resistance in crops, so that weeds can be controlled without harming crops.Insect and pest resistance can be developed and inserted into the crop plants. The plants produce toxins, which would kill insects eating the crop.Risks of genetic engineeringTransfer of the selected gene into other species. GM crops might breed with wild relatives of the crop plants.Some people believe it is not ethical to interfere with nature in this way.GM crop seeds are more expensive. Crop growers cannot collect seed from their plants and sow them, because they are different genetically - they must buy new seeds every year - so people in developing countries may not be able to afford them.GM crops could be harmful, for example toxins from the crops have been detected in some people__ blood.GM crops could cause allergic reactions in people.Pollen produced by the plants could be toxic and harm insects that transfer it between plants.",Evolution,Inheritance,"Preventing, treating and curing diseases",Combined Science
157,Steps in genetic engineering - Higher,"The main steps of genetic engineering:Enzymes are used to isolate the required gene, this gene is inserted into a vector, which is usually a bacterial plasmid or a virus.The vector inserts the gene into required cells.The genes are transferred to animal, plant or microorganism cells, during early development. This allows them to develop with the desired characteristics.This diagram shows how the genetic engineering of a bacterium to produce insulin works:",Evolution,Inheritance,Transport into and out of cells,Building blocks
158,Mendeleev's periodic table,"Early attempts to classify elementsBefore discovering protons, neutrons and electrons, scientists tried to classify the 
elements by arranging them in order of their atomic weights. The atomic weight of an element is equivalent to what we now call its relative atomic mass.Early periodic tables were incomplete, since many elements were unknown. Also, some elements were placed in groups with elements that were not similar to them.Dmitri MendeleevDmitri Mendeleev was a Russian chemist. He wrote chemistry books and was looking for ways to organise the known elements. He published his first periodic table of the elements in 1869. In it, he arranged the elements in order of increasing atomic weights. He also took into account the properties of the elements and their compounds. This meant that his table:had gaps in itshowed elements with similar chemical properties lined up in groupsPredictions using gapsMendeleev left gaps for elements not known at the time. By looking at the properties of the elements next to a gap, he predicted the properties of undiscovered elements. For example, Mendeleev predicted the existence of 'eka-silicon', which would fit into a gap next to silicon. Another scientist later discovered the missing element, which was named germanium. Its properties were found to be similar to the predicted ones and confirmed Mendeleev's periodic table.Pair reversalsIodine has a lower atomic weight than tellurium. So iodine should be placed before tellurium in Mendeleev's periodic table. However, iodine has similar chemical properties to chlorine and bromine. To make iodine line up with chlorine and bromine in his table, Mendeleev swapped the positions of iodine and tellurium.Mendeleev didn't know about isotopes, but their existence explains pair reversals. The positions of iodine and tellurium were reversed in Mendeleev's table because:iodine has one naturally occurring isotope, iodine-127the most abundant tellurium isotopes are tellurium-128 and tellurium-130The high relative abundance of these tellurium isotopes gives tellurium the greater relative atomic mass. The atomic number of tellurium is 52 and the atomic number of iodine is 53, so these elements are in the correct order in the modern periodic table.Mendeleev's periodic table",The periodic table,Atomic structure,The periodic table,Atomic structure
159,The modern periodic table,"In the modern periodic table:elements are arranged in rows, called periods, in order of increasing atomic numberelements with similar properties are placed in vertical columns, called groupselements in the same group have the same number of electrons in their outer shell (this is what gives them similar properties)The table is called the periodic table because elements with similar properties occur at regular intervals.The modern periodic table with some elements left out for simplicityRemember that the periodic table only lists elements, so you won't find compounds (eg water) or alloys, eg bronze listed there.",The periodic table,Atomic structure,The periodic table,The periodic table
160,Electronic structure ,"An electronic structure is the way in which electrons are arranged in an atom.Electrons in shellsElectrons in atoms occupy energy levels, also called electron shells, outside the nucleus. Different shells can hold different maximum numbers of electrons. The electrons in an atom occupy the lowest available energy level first. This is the shell nearest the nucleus. When this shell is full the electrons begin to occupy the next energy level:Energy level shellMaximum number of electronsFirst2Second8Third8the first shell, which is the one closest to the nucleus of an atom, can hold a maximum of two electronsthe second shell, which is a little further from the nucleus, can hold a maximum of eight electrons the third shell, which is further from the nucleus, can hold a maximum of eight electronsAny other electrons will be found in the fourth shell. This model will work for any atom in the periodic table up to calcium.Predicting an electronic structureThe electronic structure of an atom can be predicted from its atomic number. For example, the atomic number of sodium is 11. Sodium atoms have 11 protons and so 11 electrons:two electrons occupy the first shelleight electrons occupy the second shellone electron occupies the third shellThis electronic structure is written as 2,8,1 (each comma separates one shell from the next). This electronic structure can also be shown as a diagram. In these diagrams:each shell is shown as a circleeach electron is shown as a dot or a crossThe electronic structure of sodium as a diagramElectronic structure and the periodic tableThe electronic structure of an element is related to its position in the periodic table .Electronic structure featureLink to the periodic tableNumber or numbers of shellsPeriod numberNumber of electrons in outermost shellGroup numberTotal number of electronsAtomic numberThe electronic structure of sodium (2,8,1) shows that sodium, Na:is in period 3is in group 1has an atomic number of (2 + 8 + 1) = 11",The periodic table,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
161,Metals versus non-metals,"The majority of elements are metals. In the periodic table:metals are found to the left and towards the bottom of the periodic tablenon-metals are found towards the top right of the stepped lineMetals are on the left of the periodic table, and non-metals are on the rightAtomic structure and the periodic tableElements in group 1 and group 2 are metals. Atoms of group 1 elements have one electron in their outer shell, and atoms of group 2 elements have two electrons in their outer shell. Some elements in groups 6 and 7, and all in group 0 (also known as group 8) are non-metals. Atoms of group 7 elements have seven electrons in their outer shell, and atoms of group 0 elements, except helium, have eight electrons in their outer shell.The reactions of elements are related to the number of electrons in their outer shells:Atoms of metal elements give away electrons in their reactions to form positive ions. The ions formed have a full outer electron shell, so are very stable.Atoms of reactive non-metal elements gain electrons in some of their reactions to form negative ions. The ions formed have a full outer electron shell, so are very stable.Differences in chemical propertiesMost elements are metals. In their chemical reactions, metals atoms lose electrons to form positive ions. For example:when magnesium burns in air, each atom loses two electrons to form an Mg2+ ionwhen sodium reacts with chlorine, each sodium atom loses one electron to form a Na+ ionA sodium atom, Na, forms a Na+ ion by losing an electronElements that do not form positive ions in their chemical reaction are non-metals.most metal oxides are basicmost non-metal oxides are acidicDifferences in physical propertiesMetal and non-metal elements have different physical properties:most metals have high melting and boiling pointsmost non-metals have low melting and boiling pointsThe table shows some other differences in physical properties.Properties of a typical metal (when solid)Properties of a typical non-metal (when solid)Good conductor of electricity Poor conductor of electricityGood conductor of heatPoor conductor of heatShinyDullHigh densityLow densityMalleable (can be hammered into different shapes)Brittle (breaks easily)Ductile (can be pulled into wires)Brittle (breaks easily)",The periodic table,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Electrons and chemical reactions
162,Group 0,"Group 0 contains non-metal elements placed in the vertical column on the far right of the periodic table. The elements in group 0 are called the noble gases.  They exist as single atoms.Group 0 is on the far right-hand side of the periodic tableThe noble gases show trends in their physical properties.Boiling pointsThe noble gases all have low boiling points:helium, at the top of group 0, has the lowest boiling point of any elementboiling point increases going down the groupThe boiling points of group 0 elementsThis is because, going down group 0:the atoms become largerthe intermolecular forces between the atoms become strongermore energy is needed to overcome these forcesQuestionRadon is situated below xenon in group 0. Predict the likely boiling point of radon.Reveal answerupdownThe actual boiling point of radon is -61.7_C. An estimate would lie midway between -100_C and -50_C based on the shape of the graph.Compared to other elements, the noble gases are very unreactive - they do not take part in chemical reactions.Explaining the inertness of noble gasesThe table shows the electronic structures of some noble gases. All the noble gases have complete outer shells:helium has only two electronsthe other elements have eight electrons in the outer shellElementElectronic structureHelium2Neon2,8Argon2,8,8When elements react, their atoms complete their outer shells by losing, gaining, or sharing electrons. Atoms of group 0 elements already have stable arrangements of electrons. This means that they have no tendency to lose, gain, or share electrons. This is why the noble gases are unreactive. It also explains why atoms of group 0 elements do not share electrons to form molecules.The arrangement of electrons in the periodic table",Groups in the periodic table,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Metals
163,Group 1,"Group 1 contains elements placed in a vertical column on the far left of the periodic table. The elements in group 1 are called the alkali metals.Group 1 is on the left-hand side of the periodic tableThe alkali metals share similar physical properties. For example, they:are soft (they can be cut with a knife)have relatively low melting pointshave low densitiesQuestionThe table shows the melting points of five alkali metals.

This means that the alkali metals all have similar chemical properties.When a group 1 element takes part in a reaction, its atoms each lose one electron. This forms positively charged ions. The ions have a stable arrangement of electrons, with a complete outer shell.Reactions with waterThe alkali metals react with water to produce a metal hydroxide and hydrogen. For example, sodium reacts with water:sodium + water _ sodium hydroxide + hydrogen2Na(s) + 2H2O(l) _ 2NaOH(aq) + H2(g)Sodium hydroxide is an alkali.

Predict what is seen when rubidium is added to water.Reveal answerupdownRubidium melts very quickly. It burns violently and explodes.Reactions with oxygenThe group 1 elements react with oxygen from the air to make metal oxides.At room temperature, oxygen reacts with the surface of the metal. This forms a white oxide, which covers the surface. The metal below the surface does not react.The alkali metals burn vigorously when heated and placed in a gas jar of oxygen. The oxide forms as white smoke.For example:sodium + oxygen _ sodium oxide4Na(s) + O2(g) _ 2Na2O(s)The reactivity of the group 1 elements increases down the group, so their reactions with oxygen get more vigorous.QuestionPredict which becomes white more quickly on exposure to air - a piece of rubidium, or a piece of lithium. Explain your answer.Reveal answerupdownThe rubidium becomes white more quickly. This is because rubidium is below lithium in group 1, so rubidium is more reactive and so it reacts with the oxygen in the air to form an oxide layer more quickly.Reactions with chlorineThe group 1 elements react vigorously with chlorine. The products of the reactions are chlorides. At room temperature the chlorides are white solids. They dissolve in water to form colourless solutions. For example:sodium + chlorine _ sodium chloride2Na(s) + Cl2(g) _ 2NaCl(s)The reactions with chlorine get more vigorous going down the group.QuestionBalance the equation for the reaction of potassium with chlorine._____K(s) + Cl2(g) _ _____KCl(s)Reveal answerupdown2K(s) + Cl2(g) _ 2KCl(s)Explaining the trend in reactivityWhen a group 1 element takes part in a reaction, each of its atoms loses its outer electron to form a positively charged ion.

This means that it will be solid at room temperature.The test for chlorine gasTo test for chlorine, use damp blue litmus paper. The blue colour will turn to red and then to white.Chlorine gas reacts with water to produce an acidic solution which is also an effective bleach. This explains how the test for chlorine works.

173,Law of conservation of mass,"The law of conservation of mass states that no atoms are lost or made in a chemical reaction. Instead, the atoms join together in different ways to form products. This is why, in a balanced symbol equation, the number of atoms of each element is the same on both sides of the equation.Since atoms are not lost or made in a chemical reaction, the total mass of the products is equal to the total mass of the reactants. The sum of the relative formula masses of the reactants is equal to the sum of the relative formula masses of the products.No atoms are created or destroyed when copper reacts with oxygen to form copper oxideCalculations using the lawThe mass of one substance in a reaction can be calculated if the masses of the other substances are known. For example:previousnextpreviousnext1. Calcium carbonate is made up of 28 grams of calcium oxide and 22 grams of carbon dioxidepreviousnext2. To find out the amount of calcium carbonate, add the 28 grams of calcium oxide and 22 grams of carbon dioxidepreviousnext3.

Take the 80 grams of magnesium oxide and take away the 48 grams of magnesiumpreviousnext6. This leaves 32 grams of oxygenReactions in closed systemsNo substances can enter or leave a closed system, such as a stoppered flask.  Sometimes, reactions that happen in open beakers are closed systems, for example acid-alkali neutralisation reactions. Since all the reactants and products stay in the beaker, the total mass of the beaker and the substances in it stay the same during the reaction.Reactions in non-enclosed systemsSubstances can enter or leave a non-enclosed system. These systems include open flasks, boiling tubes or crucibles that let gases enter or leave. For example:copper carbonate decomposes on heating to make solid copper oxide, which stays in the boiling tube, and carbon dioxide gas, which escapesmagnesium reacts with oxygen, gained from the air, to produce magnesium oxide If a gas escapes, the total mass will look as if it has decreased. If a gas is gained, the total mass will look as if it has increased. However, the total mass stays the same if the mass of the gas is included.Worked exampleQuestion10.0 g of calcium carbonate, CaCO3, was heated in a thermal decomposition reaction. 5.60 g of solid remained after heating. The equation below represents the reaction:CaCO3(s) _ CaO(s) + CO2(g)Explain the change in mass.Reveal answerupdownThe mass appears to have decreased because one of the products, carbon dioxide, escapes to the air.

174,Relative formula mass,"Atoms have very little mass so their relative atomic masses are used. The relative atomic mass of an element, symbol Ar, is the relative mass of its atoms compared to the mass of a carbon-12 atom. The Ar values for elements are given in the periodic table. Since Ar is a measure of relative mass, it has no units.Calculating relative formula massThe relative formula mass of a substance made up of molecules is the sum of the relative atomic masses of the atoms in the numbers shown in the formula.Relative formula mass has the symbol, Mr. To calculate the Mr for a substance:work out how many atoms of each element there are in the chemical formulaadd together the Ar values for all the atoms of each element presentFor example, the formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. It consists of one carbon atom (Ar = 12) and two oxygen atoms (Ar = 16):Mr of CO2 = 12 + 16 + 16 = 44It could also be calculated this way:Mr of CO2 = (1 _ 12) + (2 _ 16) = 12 + 32 = 44Like Ar values, Mr values are just numbers. They have no units because they are relative masses.Relative formula masses of ionic compoundsIonic compounds such as sodium chloride do not exist as molecules. However, their relative formula masses are calculated in the same way, from the numbers shown in the formula.Worked exampleQuestionCalculate the relative formula mass, Mr, of calcium hydroxide, Ca(OH)2.(Ar of Ca = 40, Ar of O = 16, Ar of H = 1)Reveal answerupdownMr = 40 + (2 _ 16) + (2 _ 1)= 40 + 32 + 2= 74It could also be calculated this way:Mr = 40 + 2 _ (16 + 1)40 + 34 = 74QuestionCalculate the relative formula mass, Mr, of magnesium nitrate, Mg(NO3)2.(Ar of Mg = 24, Ar of N = 14, Ar of O = 16)Reveal answerupdownMr = 24 + (2 _ 14) + (2 _ 3 _ 16)= 24 + 28 + 96= 148It could also be calculated this way:Mr = 24 + 2 _ [14 + (16 _ 3)]= 24 + 124= 148Relative formula masses in balanced symbol equationsBecause of the law of conservation of mass, as long as a chemical equation is balanced, the sum of the Mr values of the reactants equals the sum of the Mr values of the products.",Calculations in chemistry,States of matter,The periodic table,Chemical equations

Calculate the concentration of the sodium hydroxide solution formed.concentration = \(\frac{\textup{mass~of~solute~in~g}}{\textup{volume~in~dm}^3}\)concentration = \(\frac{\textup{8~g}}{\textup{2~dm}^3}\)concentration = 4 g/dm3Volume unitsApparatus used to measure volumes is usually marked in cm3 or ml. Although these are different units, they describe the same volume. For example, 250 ml = 250 cm3.Volumes used in concentration calculations must be in dm3, not in cm3 or ml. It is useful to know that 1 dm3 = 1000 cm3. This means:divide by 1000 to convert from cm3 to dm3multiply by 1000 to convert from dm3 to cm3For example, 250 cm3 is 0.25 dm3 (250 ÷ 1000). It is often easiest to convert from cm3 to dm3 before continuing with a concentration calculation.Question100 cm3 of dilute hydrochloric acid contains 0.5 g of dissolved hydrogen chloride. Calculate the concentration of the acid in g/dm3.Reveal answerupdownvolume of acid = 100 ÷ 1000 = 0.1 dm3concentration of acid = \(\frac{\textup{0.5}}{\textup{0.1}}\)= 5 g/dm3Calculating the mass of soluteRearranging the equation for concentration allows the mass of solute to be calculated:mass of solute in g = concentration in g/dm3 _ volume in dm3Worked exampleA solution of sodium chloride has a concentration of 10 g/dm3. What mass of sodium chloride is dissolved in 2 dm3 of the solution?mass of solute in g 	= concentration in g/dm3 _ volume in dm3= 10 g/dm3 _ 2 dm3= 20 gHigher tierThe concentration of a solution can be changed:concentration can be increased by dissolving more solute in a given volume of solution - this increases the mass of the soluteconcentration can be increased by allowing some of the solvent to evaporate - this decreases the volume of the solution",Calculations in chemistry,Calculations in chemistry,Transport into and out of cells,Acids and alkalis

Non-contact forcesNon-contact forces are forces that act between two objects that are not physically touching each other. When the wind pushes against an umbrella, it can change the shape of the umbrella and/or the speed of the umbrella.What happens depends on which direction the wind is blowing and how strongly it is blowing. A measurement that needs both a size and a direction to describe it is called a vector. Vector quantities have both magnitude and an associated direction. Some examples of vector quantities include:force - 20 newtons (N) to the leftvelocity - 11 metres per second (m/s) upwardsacceleration - 9.8 metres per second squared (m/s²) downwardsThe direction of a vector can be given in a written description, or drawn as an arrow. The length of an arrow represents the magnitude of the quantity. The diagrams show three examples of vectors, drawn to different scales.A measurement that doesn't have a direction is called a scalar. Scalar quantities only have a magnitude or size.Some examples of scalar quantities include:temperature - 10 degrees Celsius (°C)mass - 5 kilograms (kg)energy - 2,000 joules (J)",Forces,Forces,Motion,Energy changes
181,Interactions,"Interactions occur between objects and are most easily represented by diagrams. No force occurs by itself, it is always as a result of a pull or push of one body on another. There are several examples:Reaction force (contact)An object at rest on a surface experiences reaction force from the table pushing up on the object. For example, a box on a table - there is the pull of the Earth down on the box and the push of the table up on the box.Friction (contact)Two objects sliding past each other experience friction forces. For example, a box sliding down a slope.Air resistance (contact)An object moving through the air experiences air resistance. For example, a skydiver falling through the air. There is contact between the body of the skydiver and the molecules that make up the air.When a contact force acts between two objects, both objects experience the same size force, but in opposite directions.

182,Free body diagrams - Higher,"Resultant forceThe resultant force is a single force that has the same overall effect as two or more forces acting together. You can easily calculate the resultant force of two forces that act in a straight line.Two forces in the same directionTwo forces that act in the same direction produce a resultant force that is greater than either individual force. Simply add the magnitudes of the two forces together.ExampleTwo forces, 3 newtons (N) and 2 N, act to the right. Calculate the resultant force.3 N + 2 N = 5 N to the rightTwo forces acting in the same directionTwo forces in opposite directionsWhen two forces that act in opposite directions it is often easiest to subtract the magnitude of the smaller force from the magnitude of the larger force. ExampleA force of 5 N acts to the right, and a force of 3 N act to the left. Calculate the resultant force.5 N _ 3 N = 2 N to the rightTwo forces acting in opposite directionsFree body diagramsA free body diagram models the forces acting on an object. The object or 'body' is usually shown as a box or a dot. The forces are shown as thin arrows pointing away from the centre of the box or dot.Representing an object in a free body diagram as a box or a dotFree body diagrams do not need to be drawn to scale but it can sometimes be useful if they are. It is important to label each arrow to show the magnitude of the force it represents. The type of force involved may also be shown.Examples of free body diagramsWeight and reaction force for a resting objectA box resting on a table experiences two forces. There is a downward pull from the Earth on the box, which we call its weight. There is also a push up on the box from the surface of the table. Because these forces are equal and opposite, there is no resultant force and so the body remains at rest.previousnextpreviousnextDrawing of situationpreviousnextFree body diagramWeight, reaction force and friction for an object placed on a hillThree forces do not have to act in a line in order for there to be no resultant force. For the body on a slope, whichever direction is chosen the forces cancel out. For example vertically, the pull of the Earth down on the body is cancelled out by the combined upward push of the reaction force and the friction force. Considering the forces acting along the slope, the pull of the Earth on the box would make it slide down the slope, but the friction force is exactly equal to cancel this out. The reaction force pushes neither up nor down the slope so does not have an effect along the slope.previousnextpreviousnextDrawing of situationpreviousnextFree body diagramWeight, upthrust, thrust and air resistance for an accelerating speedboatIn this example the boat experiences two vertical forces - a weight force downwards and an upthrust from the water on the boat. These two forces are equal and opposite so the boat does not accelerate up or down.However, horizontally the air resistance opposing the motion of the boat is not as big as the thrust, so there is a resultant force horizontally forward on the boat and as a result it accelerates forwards. previousnextpreviousnextDrawing of situationpreviousnextFree body diagram",Forces,Forces,Forces,Combined Science
183,Resolving a force - Higher,"Two forces can be added together to find a resultant force. A single force can be resolved (broken down) into two component forces at right angles to each other. In the diagram of a toy trailer below, when a child pulls on the handle, some of the 5 newton (N) force pulls the trailer upwards away from the ground and some of the force pulls it to the right.Vector diagrams can be used to resolve the pulling force into a horizontal component acting to the right and a vertical component acting upwards.Vector diagramsDraw a right-angled triangle to scale, in which each side represents a force. Try to choose a simple scale, for example 1 cm = 1 N. For the toy trailer example above, draw:a line representing the 5 N force at 37°a horizontal line ending directly below the end of the first linea vertical line between ends of the two linesarrow heads to show the direction in which each force actsMeasure the lengths of the horizontal and vertical lines. Use the scale for the first line to convert these lengths to the corresponding forces.The child's pulling force can be resolved into a 4 N force to the right and a 3 N force upwardsWhen combined, the two component forces have the same effect as the single force.

184,Work,"Jonny Nelson introduces an animated explanation of energy storesWhen a force causes a body to move, work is being done on the object by the force. Work is the measure of how much energy is transferred when a force (\(\text{F}\)) moves an object through a distance (\(\text{d}\)).So when work is done, energy has been transferred from one energy store to another. Therefore:energy transferred = work doneEnergy transferred and work done are both measured in joules (J).Calculating work doneThe amount of work done when a force acts on a body depends on two things:the size of the force acting on the objectthe distance through which the force causes the body to move in the direction of the forceThe equation used to calculate the work done is:work done = force _ distance\[\text{W} = \text{F} \times \text{s}\]This is when:work done (\(\text{W}\)) is measured in joules (J)force (\(\text{F}\)) is measured in newtons (N)distance (\(\text{s}\)) is in the same direction as the force and is measured in metres (m)ExampleIn this example, a force of 10 N causes the box to move a horizontal distance of 2 m.\[\text{W} = \text{F} \times \text{s}\]\(\text{W}\) = 10 _ 2 \(\text{W}\) = 20 Jcurriculum-key-factOne joule of work is done (or one joule of energy is transferred) when a force of one newton causes a body to move through a distance of one metre.

185,Mass and weight,"The weight of an object is the force acting on the object's mass due to gravity. The weight of an object can be practically measured using a newtonmeter, which is a spring balance.The weight of an object and its mass are directly proportional. This means that, for a given gravitational field strength, doubling the mass would double the weight.Scientists write this type of relationship in a short form as:\[\text{W} \alpha \text{m}\]Weight can be calculated using the equation:weight = mass _ gravitational field strength\[\text{W} = \text{mg}\]This is when:weight (\(\text{W}\)) is measured in newtons (N)mass (\(\text{m}\)) is measured in kilograms (kg)gravitational field strength (\(\text{g}\)) is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg)The Moon is smaller and has less mass than the Earth, so its gravitational field strength is only about one-sixth of the Earth's. For example, a 120 kg astronaut weighs 1,200 N on Earth but only 200 N on the Moon. Remember that the mass would still be 120 kg.ExampleAn apple has a mass of 100 g. Calculate its weight on Earth (\(\text{g}\) = 9.8 N/kg).100 g = 100 ÷ 1000 = 0.1 kg\[\text{W} = \text{mg}\]\(\text{W}\) = 0.1 kg _ 9.8 N/kg\(\text{W}\) = 0.98 NQuestionCalculate the weight of a 30 kg dog (\(\text{g}\) = 9.8 N/kg).Reveal answerupdown\[\text{W} = \text{mg}\]\(\text{W}\) = 30 kg _ 9.8 N/kg\(\text{W}\) = 294 N",Energy changes,Energy changes,States of matter,Energy changes

A glass on the floor stays stable, one on a table can drop and smash.The amount of gravitational potential energy stored by an object at height can be calculated using the equation: Gravitational potential energy = mass _ gravitational field strength _ height\[\text{E}_{p} = \text{mgh}\]This is when: gravitational potential energy (\(\text{E}_{p}\)) is measured in joules (J) mass (\(\text{m}\)) is measured in kilograms (kg) gravitational field strength (\(\text{g}\)) is measured in newtons per kilogram (N/kg) height (\(\text{h}\)) is measured in metres (m) ExampleA 5 kg object is taken to the top of a building.

187,Elastic deformation,"When a force acts on an object, the object may change shape by bending, stretching or compressing _ or a combination of all three shape changes. However, there must be more than one force acting to change the shape of a stationary object in the following ways:pull an object's ends apart, eg when a rubber band is stretchedpush an object's ends together, eg when an empty drinks can is squashedbend an object's ends past each other, eg a weight on a bridge A change in shape is called deformation:elastic deformation is reversed when the force is removedinelastic deformation is not fully reversed when the force is removed _ there is a permanent change in shapeA rubber band undergoes elastic deformation when stretched a little. A metal drinks can undergoes inelastic deformation when it is squashed.Hooke's lawExtension and compressionExtension happens when an object increases in length, and compression happens when it decreases in length. The extension of an elastic object, such as a spring, is described by Hooke's law:force = spring constant _ extension\[\text{F} = \text{ke}\]This is when:force (\(\text{F}\)) is measured in newtons (N)spring constant (\(\text{k}\)) is measured in newtons per metre (N/m)extension, or increase in length (\(\text{e}\)) is measured in metres (m)ExampleA force of 3 N is applied to a spring. The spring stretches reversibly by 0.15 m _ the fact that the string stretches reversibly means that it will go back to its normal shape after the force has been removed. Calculate the spring constant.First rearrange \(\text{F} = \text{ke}\) to find \(\text{k}\):\[\text{k} = \frac{\text{F}}{\text{e}}\]Then calculate using the values in the question:\(\text{k}\) = 3 ÷ 0.15\(\text{k}\) = 20 N/mLimit of proportionalitySpring constant is a measure of the stiffness of a spring up to its limit of proportionality or elastic limit. The limit of proportionality refers to the point beyond which Hooke's law is no longer true when stretching a material. The elastic limit of a material is the furthest amount it can be stretched or deformed without being able to return to its previous shape. Once a material has gone past its elastic limit, its deformation is said to be inelastic. The higher the spring constant, the stiffer the spring. The spring constant is different for different elastic objects. For a given spring and other elastic objects, the extension is directly proportional to the force applied. For example, if the force is doubled, the extension doubles. This works until the limit of proportionality is exceeded. Work needs to be done to stretch the spring and this is stored in the spring as elastic potential energy.When an elastic object is stretched beyond its limit of proportionality, the object does not return to its original length when the force is removed. In this instance, the relationship between force and extension changes from being linear, or directly proportional, to being non-linear.Non-linear extension occurs more in some materials than others. Materials like clay or putty usually show non-linear extension.Force - extension graphsLinear extension and elastic deformation can be seen below the limit of proportionality. Non-linear extension and inelastic deformation can be seen above the limit of proportionality. The limit of proportionality is also described as the elastic limit.",Energy changes,Forces,Forces,Forces

The structure and bonding of substances with small molecules explains their properties.Low melting points and boiling pointsMost substances with simple molecules have low melting points and boiling points.  Many are in the liquid or gas state at room temperature.Melting and boilingMelting and boiling are changes of state.Energy must be transferred to a substance to make it melt or boil. This energy overcomes the attractive forces between the particles in the substance:some forces of attraction are overcome during melting, allowing molecules to move over each othermore of the forces of attraction are overcome during boiling, allowing the molecules to move freely away from each otherThe more energy that is needed, the higher the melting point or boiling point.ExplanationThere are intermolecular forces between simple molecules. Intermolecular forces are much weaker than the strong covalent bonds in molecules. When simple molecular substances melt or boil, it is these weak intermolecular forces that are overcome. The covalent bonds are not broken. Relatively little energy is needed to overcome the intermolecular forces, so simple molecular substances have low melting and boiling points.SubstanceMelting pointBoiling pointState at 20°CO2-218°C-183°CGasH2O0°C100°CLiquidThe intermolecular forces between water molecules are stronger than those between oxygen molecules.In general, the bigger the molecule, the stronger the intermolecular forces, so the higher the melting and boiling points.Conduction of electricityA substance can conduct electricity if:it contains charged particles, andthese particles are free to move from place to placeSmall molecules have no overall electric charge, so they cannot conduct electricity, even when liquid or dissolved in water.curriculum-key-factWhen simple molecular substances melt or boil, their weak intermolecular forces are overcome, not their strong covalent bonds.Properties of polymersPolymers are made up of very large molecules.

This sharing of delocalised electrons results in strong metallic bonding.A model showing how metallic bonds are formed - the first diagram shows the outer electrons in their atoms, and the second diagram shows that the electrons have become delocalised",Metals,Atomic structure,Atomic structure,Atomic structure
200,Properties of metals,"The structure and bonding of metals explains their properties:They are electrical conductors because their delocalised electrons carry electrical charge through the metal.They are good conductors of thermal energy because their delocalised electrons transfer energy.They have high melting points  and boiling points, because the metallic bonding in the giant structure of a metal is very strong - large amounts of energy are needed to overcome the metallic bonds in melting and boiling.They are malleable, which means they can be bent and shaped easily. In pure metals, the atoms are arranged in neat layers, and when a force is applied to the metal (eg by being hit with a hammer), the layers of metal atoms can slide over each other, giving the metal a new shape.QuestionExplain why metals can conduct electricity.Reveal answerupdownMetals conduct electricity because they have delocalised electrons. These carry electrical charge through the metal.AlloysAn alloy is a mixture of two or more elements, where at least one element is a metal. Many alloys are mixtures of two or more metals.Comparing properties of alloys and pure metalsMany pure metals are too soft for many uses. They can be made harder by adding another element to the pure metal, so forming an alloy. This explains why an alloy often has more uses than the pure elements it is made from.Pure iron, for example, is very soft. Adding a small amount of tungsten to iron makes tool steel, which is harder than pure iron. Steels are examples of alloys. There are many types of steel.SteelElementsPropertiesMild steelCarbon and ironEasy to bend and pull into wiresTool steelTungsten and ironHard, can be heated to high temperaturesStainless steelChromium and ironHard, does not rust easilyExplaining alloy hardnessIn the solid state, a pure metal has a giant metallic structure. The atoms are arranged in layers. When a force is applied, the layers may slide over each other. 
        The harder and stronger the metal, the greater the force is needed to change or bend it.In a pure metal, the force needed to make the layers slide over each other is small. This explains why many pure metals are soft.In an alloy, there are atoms of different sizes. The smaller or bigger atoms distort the layers of atoms in the pure metal. This means that a greater force is required for the layers to slide over each other. The alloy is harder and stronger than the pure metal.Alloys contain atoms of different sizes, making it harder for layers of atoms to slide over each otherQuestionExplain why steel, which is an alloy of iron, is harder than pure iron.Reveal answerupdownSteel contains atoms of other elements as well as iron. These atoms have different sizes to iron atoms, so they distort the layers of atoms in the pure iron. This means that a greater force is required for the layers to slide over each other in steel, so steel is harder than pure iron.",Metals,The periodic table,Metals,Metals
201,Magnets,"A magnet can exert a force on another nearby magnet. Magnets have two poles:a north polea south poleThe magnetic force is strongest near the magnet's poles.The rules of magnetismTwo magnets will either attract or repel each other in the following way:like poles (N__ or S__) repelunlike poles (N__ or S__) attract Magnetic forces are non-contact forces _ this means that magnets affect each other without touching.Induced and permanent magnetismIron, steel, nickel and cobalt are magnetic materials. They are affected by magnets and are attracted to either pole of a magnet.Permanent magnetsA permanent magnet is often made from a magnetic material such as iron. A permanent magnet always causes a force on other magnets, or on magnetic materials. Key features of a permanent magnet:it produces its own magnetic fieldthe magnetic field cannot be turned on and off _ it is there all the timeBar magnets and horseshoe magnets are examples of permanent magnets.Induced magnetsUnlike a permanent magnet, an induced magnet only becomes a magnet when it is placed in a magnetic field. The induced magnetism is quickly lost when the magnet is removed from the magnetic field.Like all induced magnets:they are only attracted by other magnets, they are not repelledthey lose most or all of their magnetism when they are removed from the magnetic field",Magnetism and electromagnetism,Forces,Magnetism and electromagnetism,Interactions over small and large distances
202,Magnetic fields,"Iron filings are attracted to a bar magnetA magnetic field is the region around a magnet where a force acts on another magnet or on a magnetic material. Iron, steel, cobalt and nickel are all magnetic materials and would feel force from a nearby magnet.Detecting magnetic fieldsA magnetic field is invisible, but it can be detected using a magnetic compass. A compass contains a small bar magnet on a pivot so that it can rotate. The compass needle points in the direction of the Earth's magnetic field, or the magnetic field of a magnet.Magnetic fields can be mapped out using small plotting compasses:place the plotting compass near the magnet on a piece of papermark the direction the compass needle pointsmove the plotting compass to many different positions in the magnetic field, marking the needle direction each timejoin the points to show the field linesThe needle of a plotting compass points to the south pole of the magnet.The behaviour of a compass shows that the Earth has a magnetic field. The Earth's core, which is made from iron and nickel, produces this magnetic field.Drawing a magnetic fieldMagnetic field lines around a bar magnet The diagram shows these key features:the magnetic field lines never cross each otherthe closer the lines, the stronger the magnetic field (so the magnetic field from a bar magnet is strongest closest to the poles)the lines have arrowheads to show the direction of the force exerted by a magnetic north polethe arrowheads point from the north pole of the magnet to its south pole",Magnetism and electromagnetism,Magnetism and electromagnetism,Magnetism and electromagnetism,Magnetism and electromagnetism
203,The Earth's magnetism,"The outer core of the Earth contains a lot of iron in a molten state. As the Earth spins this molten iron moves and creates the Earth's magnetic field. The Earth behaves as if there is a huge bar magnet at its centre.The shape of the field around the Earth is very similar to the field around a bar magnetThe switching of the polesA compass needle is a very small, thin magnet. Today, the north pole of a compass needle points towards the 'top' of the Earth. This means that the top of the Earth must be acting as a South magnetic pole (unlike poles attract).Changing temperatures and the liquid iron flowing around the core cause the strength of the magnetic field to change but also cause the poles to switch places. Today, the top of the Earth is a South pole but in the past it has been a North pole.Magnetic pole reversals leave traces in the geological recordScientists have shown that there have been almost 200 pole switches in the last 100 million years. The last one was about 800,000 years ago.",Magnetism and electromagnetism,Combined Science,Magnetism and electromagnetism,Magnetism and electromagnetism
204,Electricity and magnetism,"When a charged particle, such as a proton or electron, moves it causes a magnetic effect. It is, in fact, the movement of the electrons in the molten iron core that create the Earth's magnetic field.When a current flows in a wire, it creates a circular magnetic field around the wire. This magnetic field can deflect the needle of a magnetic compass. The strength of the magnetic field is greater:closer to the wireif the current is increasedMagnetic fields around a wire carrying an electric currentThe right hand grip ruleIt is often useful to be able to remember which way the field points (the direction a compass needle will point) when placed near the wire. The easiest way to do this is called the 'right hand grip rule'.Hold out your right hand with your thumbs tucked in and your thumb pointing upwards:the thumb is equal to the direction of currentthe fingers are equal to the magnetic field direction",Magnetism and electromagnetism,Forces,Forces,Atomic structure
205,Electromagnets,"SolenoidsA solenoid consists of a wire coiled up into a spiral shape. When an electric current flows, the shape of the magnetic field is very similar to the field of a bar magnet. The field inside a solenoid is strong and uniform. The small magnetic fields caused by the current in each coil add together to make a stronger overall magnetic field. A solenoid, shown here in cross section, has a stronger electromagnetic field than a single straight wireJust as with the bar magnet, the strongest part of the electromagnet can be felt at the two ends. ElectromagnetsA solenoid with an iron core is called an electromagnet. The iron core increases the solenoid's magnetic field strength. A simple electromagnet is made by coiling wire around an iron nail.The strength of the electromagnet can be increased by passing more electric current through the coils and/or wrapping more coils around the iron core.Electromagnets are used in devices such as electric bells, and door locks that can be controlled remotely. Electromagnets have some advantages over permanent magnets. For example:they can be turned on and offthe strength of the magnetic field can be variedThese properties make electromagnets useful for picking up scrap iron and steel in scrapyards.",Magnetism and electromagnetism,Magnetism and electromagnetism,Magnetism and electromagnetism,Magnetism and electromagnetism
206,The motor effect _ Higher,"A wire carrying a current creates a magnetic field. This can interact with another magnetic field, causing a force that pushes the wire at right angles. This is called the motor effect.There is a force at right angles to the current and the magnetic fieldFleming's left hand rule - HigherThe force on a given length of wire in a magnetic field increases when:the current in the wire increasesthe strength of the magnetic field increasesthe length of conductor in the field is increasedFor any given combination of current and magnetic field strength, the force is greatest when the direction of the current is 90° to the direction of the magnetic field. There is no motor effect force if the current and magnetic field are parallel to each other.The direction of a motor effect force can be found using Fleming's left hand rule. Hold your thumb, forefinger and second finger at right angles to each other:the forefinger is lined up with magnetic field lines pointing from north to souththe second finger is lined up with the current pointing from positive to negativethe thumb shows the direction of the motor effect force on the conductor carrying the currentIn which direction will this wire feel a force?With forefinger (magnetic field) pointing left to right, and second finger (current) pointing down, your left thumb (force) will point towards you. This is the direction in which the force acts.Note that the direction of the force can be changed by changing either the direction of the current or the field.Calculating the motor effect forceTo calculate the force on a wire carrying a current at right angles to a magnetic field, use the equation:force = magnetic flux density _ current _ length\[\text{F} = \text{BIl}\]This is when:\(\text{F}\) is force in newtons (N)\(\text{B}\) is magnetic flux density (magnetic field strength) in tesla (T)\(\text{I}\) is current in amperes _ also referred to as amps _ (A)\(\text{l}\) is length in metres (m)Example2 A flows through a 50 cm wire.

Jonny Nelson introduces an animated explanation of electromagnetismExplaining an electric motorThe diagram shows a simple motor using direct current (dc).Fleming's left hand rule can be used to explain why the coil turnsStarting from the position shown in the diagram of the dc motor:current in the left hand part of the coil causes a downward force and current in the right hand part of the coil causes an upward forcethe coil rotates anti-clockwise because of the forces described aboveWhen the coil is vertical, it moves parallel to the magnetic field, producing no force. This would tend to make the motor come to a stop, but two features allow the coil to continue rotating:the momentum of the motor carries it on round a littlea split ring commutator changes the current direction every half turnOnce the conducting brushes reconnect with the commutator after a half turn:current flows in the opposite direction through the wire in the coileach side of the coil is now near the opposite magnetic poleThis means that the motor effect forces continue to cause anti-clockwise rotation of the coil.",Magnetism and electromagnetism,Forces,Magnetism and electromagnetism,Interactions over small and large distances
208,"Speed, distance and time","Distance is how far an object moves. It does not include an associated direction, so distance is a scalar quantity.Speed is the rate of change of distance _ it is the distance travelled per unit time. Like distance, speed does not have an associated direction, so it is a scalar quantity.Typical speedsWhen people walk, run, or travel in a car their speed will change. They may speed up, slow down or pause for traffic. The speed at which a person can walk, run or cycle depends on many factors including:ageterrainfitnessdistance travelledSome typical values for speed in metres per second (m/s) include:Method of travelTypical speed in m/swalking1.5running3cycling6car13 - 30train50aeroplane250It is not only moving objects whose speed can vary. The speed of the wind and the speed of sound also vary. A typical value for the speed of sound in air is about 330 m/s.The velocity of an object is its speed in a particular direction. Velocity is a vector quantity because it has both a magnitude and an associated direction. To calculate velocity, displacement is used in calculations, rather than distance.Unlike distance, which is a scalar quantity, displacement is a vector quantity. It includes:the distance travelled, measured in a straight line from start to finishthe direction of the straight line",Motion,Motion,Motion,Motion

211,Free fall,"Near the surface of the Earth, any object falling freely will have an acceleration of about 9.8 metres per second squared (m/s2 ). Objects falling through a fluid eventually reach terminal velocity. At terminal velocity, the object moves at a steady speed in a constant direction because the resultant force acting on it is zero. For example, a skydiver falling spread-eagled through the air reaches a maximum speed of about 53 m/s.Three stages of fallingThere are three stages as an object falls through a fluid.At the start, the object accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity.As the object's speed increases, frictional forces such as air resistance or drag increase.At terminal velocity, the weight of the object due to gravity is balanced by the frictional forces and the resultant force is zero.The weight of an object does not change as it falls, as long as it stays whole. A skydiverThe diagram shows what happens to the speed of a skydiver from when they leave the aircraft, to when they reach the ground after their parachute opens.Before the parachute opens:Immediately on leaving the aircraft, the skydiver accelerates downwards due to the force of gravity. There is no air resistance acting in the upwards direction, and there is a resultant force acting downwards. The skydiver accelerates towards the ground.As the skydiver gains speed, their weight stays the same but the air resistance increases. There is still a resultant force acting downwards, but this gradually decreases.Eventually, the skydiver's weight is balanced by the air resistance. There is no resultant force and the skydiver reaches terminal velocity.When the parachute opens, the air resistance increases. The skydiver slows down until a new, lower terminal velocity is reached.Note that the skydiver does not go upwards when the parachute opens, even though this can appear to happen when a skydiver is being filmed. The illusion happens because the person with the camera opens their parachute later on, so falls downwards past the skydiver.Finding distance during freefall - HigherThe distance a skydiver falls can be found from the area of a speed-time graph of the descent. However, there is more of a challenge because the lines are not straight and so calculating area is not possible. Instead the area is found by finding the area of one square and then counting the number of squares under the curve so that the distance fallen is given by:Distance = distance represented by one square _ number of squares",Motion,Forces,Motion,Motion
212,Circular motion _ Higher,"When an object moves in a circle at a constant speed, its direction constantly changes. A change in direction causes a change in velocity. This is because velocity is a vector quantity _ it has an associated direction as well as a magnitude. A change in velocity results in acceleration, so an object moving in a circle is accelerating even though its speed may be constant.An object will only accelerate if a resultant force acts on it. For an object moving in a circle, this resultant force is the centripetal force that acts towards the middle of the circle. Gravitational attraction provides the centripetal force needed to keep planets and all types of satellite in orbit.ExampleForce provided byConker on a stringTension in the string on the conkerCar on a roundaboutFriction from the road on the tyresSatelliteGravitational pull of the Earth on the satelliteArtificial satellites travel in one of two different orbits:polar orbitsgeostationary orbitsPolar orbits take the satellites over the Earth's poles. The satellites travel very close to the Earth (as low as 200 km above sea level), so they must travel at very high speeds (nearly 8,000 m/s).Geostationary satellites take 24 hours to orbit the Earth, so the satellite appears to remain in the same part of the sky when viewed from the ground. These orbits are much higher than polar orbits (typically 36,000 km) so the satellites travel more slowly (around 2,000 km/s). ",Motion,Motion,Motion,Motion

214,Newton's first law,"According to Newton's first law of motion, an object remains in the same state of motion unless a resultant force acts on it. If the resultant force on an object is zero this means:a stationary object stays stationarya moving object continues to move at the same velocity (at the same speed and in the same direction)Examples of objects with uniform velocityNewton's first law can be used to explain the movement of objects travelling with uniform velocity. For example, when a car travels at a constant speed, the driving force from the engine is balanced by resistive forces such as air resistance and frictional forces in the car's moving parts. The resultant force on the car is zero.Other examples include:a runner at their top speed experiences the same air resistance as their thrustan object falling at terminal velocity experiences the same air resistance as its weightIf the forces acting on an object are balanced, the resultant force is zeroExamples of objects with non-uniform velocityNewton's first law can also be used to explain the movement of objects travelling with non-uniform motion. This includes situations when the speed changes, the direction changes or both change. For example, when a car accelerates, the driving force from the engine is greater than the resistive forces. The resultant force is not zero.Other examples include:at the start of their run, a runner experiences less air resistance than their thrust, so they acceleratean object that begins to fall experiences less air resistance than its weight, so it acceleratesIf the forces acting on an object are not balanced, the resultant force is not zeroForces on a submarineThe submarine above has both vertical forces and horizontal forces acting on it. The horizontal forces will not affect its vertical movement and the vertical forces will not affect its horizontal movement.The horizontal forces are equal in size and opposite in direction. They are balanced, so the horizontal resultant force is zero. This means that there is no horizontal acceleration. The vertical forces are equal in size and opposite in direction. They are balanced, so the vertical resultant force is also zero. This means that there is no resultant vertical acceleration. The submarine will continue with the same motion, either remaining stationary or moving at a constant speed. If the submarine is moving, it is impossible to tell which direction it is moving from the forces alone, only that it will continue in the same direction at the same speed.",Newton's laws,Forces,Motion,Motion

The symbol α is often used to represent proportionality. So, to a scientist, \(\text{a α F}\), means acceleration is proportional to the force.Inversely proportional to the mass of the object (\(\text{a} \alpha \frac{1}{\text{m}}\)).In other words, the acceleration of an object increases if the resultant force on it increases, and decreases if the mass of the object increases.ExampleCalculate the force needed to accelerate a 22 kg cheetah at 15 m/s².\[\text{F} = \text{ma}\]= 22 _ 15= 330 NQuestionCalculate the force needed to accelerate a 15 kg gazelle at 10 m/s².Reveal answerupdown\[\text{F} = \text{ma}\]= 15 _ 10= 150 NEstimationsIt is important to be able to estimate speeds, accelerations and forces involved in road vehicles.

If there is only one force, then that is the resultant force. But if there are two or more forces acting, it is important to realise that of all the acting forces are resultant, which causes a body to accelerate.

216,Newton's third law,"According to Newton's third law of motion, whenever two objects interact, they exert equal and opposite forces on each other. This is often worded as 'every action has an equal and opposite reaction'. However, it is important to remember that the forces act between two objects at the same time.Examples of force pairs Pushing a pramThere are contact forces between the person and the pram:the person pushes the pram forwardsthe pram pushes the person backwardsCar tyre on a roadThere are contact forces between the tyre and the road:the tyre pushes the road backwardsthe road pushes the tyre forwardsA satellite in Earth orbitThere are non-contact gravitational forces between Earth and the satellite:the Earth pulls the satellitethe satellite pulls EarthExplaining Newton's third lawScience presenter Jon Chase explains Newton's third law",Newton's laws,Forces,Newton's laws,Forces

In this required practical activity, it is important to:make and record measurements of length, mass and time accuratelymeasure and observe the effect of forceuse appropriate apparatus and methods to measure motionThe diagram shows apparatus that can be used in this investigation. A constant stream of air reduces the friction between the glider and the air track.Aim of the experimentTo investigate the effect of varying the force on the acceleration of an object.MethodPosition an air track on a bench with a bench pulley at one end and two light gates above the track. Cut an interrupt card to a known length (such as 10 cm) and attach it to an air track glider.Connect the glider to a hanging mass by a string the length of the air track passing over the bench pulley.Set the data logging software to calculate acceleration.Add adhesive substance 4 _ 50 g masses onto the side of the glider.Add 1 _ 50 g slotted masses (0.49 N of force) to the end of the string.Release the glider and record the acceleration.Repeat this measurement two more times and average the accelerations measured.Move one of the 50 g masses from the glider onto the hanger.Repeat steps 6 to 8 until there are no more masses left on the glider.At the end of the experiment, weigh the glider, masses, string and adhesive substance altogether.ResultsIt is important to record results in a suitable table, like the one below, which shows a set of example acceleration results in m/s2:Force in NRun 1Run 2Run 3Mean2.450.220.270.370.291.960.200.290.210.231.470.260.110.170.180.980.210.100.050.120.490.040.060.110.07AnalysisPlot a line graph with acceleration on the vertical axis and force on the horizontal axis.

219,Kinetic energy,Kinetic energy is one type of energy store. It is the energy stored in a moving body. The amount of kinetic energy stored in a body depends on its mass and its speed.Calculating energy in the kinetic storeThe amount of kinetic energy of a moving object can be calculated using the equation:Kinetic energy =  ½  _ mass _ velocity2\[\text E_{k} = \frac{1}{2} \text m v^{2}\]This is when:energy (\(\text E_{k}\)) is measured in joules (J)mass (\(\text{m}\)) is measured in kilograms (kg)velocity (\(\text{v}\)) is measured in metres per second (m/s)ExampleAn apple of mass 100 g falls from a tree.

220,Stopping distances,"In an emergency, a driver must bring their vehicle to a stop in the shortest distance possible:stopping distance = thinking distance + braking distanceThis is when:thinking distance is the distance a vehicle travels in the time it takes for the driver to apply the brakes after realising they need to stopbraking distance is the distance a vehicle travels in the time after the driver has applied the brakeReaction timesReaction times vary from person to person, but is typically between 0.2 s and 0.9 s. A driver's reaction time can be affected by:tirednessdrugsalcoholdistractionsLonger reaction times increase the thinking distance when stopping from a given speed.There are different ways to measure reaction times. One simple method involves dropping a ruler between someone's open thumb and forefinger. The higher the reaction time needed to grasp the falling ruler, the further the ruler falls before being stopped. The ruler can be adjusted to measure in seconds rather than in millimetres.Braking distanceThe braking distance of a vehicle can be affected by:poor road and weather conditions, such as wet or icy roadspoor vehicle conditions, such as worn brakes or worn tyresmass of the vehicleinitial speed of the vehicleThe faster a vehicle travels, the greater the braking force needed to stop it in a certain distance. A greater braking force produces a greater deceleration. Large decelerations may cause the brakes to overheat and the driver may also lose control of the vehicle.Typical stopping distancesIt is important to be able to:estimate how the stopping distance for a vehicle varies with different speedsinterpret graphs relating speed to stopping distanceThe diagram shows some typical stopping distances for an average car in normal conditions.Some typical stopping distancesTravelling at 20 mph (32 km/h):thinking distance = 6 mbraking distance = 6 mtotal stopping distance = 12 m Travelling at 40 mph (64 km/h):thinking distance = 12 mbraking distance = 24 mtotal stopping distance = 36 m It is important to note that the thinking distance is proportional to the starting speed. This means that it increases proportionally as speed increases, ie if speed doubles, thinking distance also doubles. However, the braking distance increases by a factor of four each time the starting speed doubles.For example, if a car doubles its speed from 30 mph to 60 mph, the thinking distance will double from 9 m to 18 m and the braking distance will increase by a factor of four from 14 m to 56 m. ",Newton's laws,Motion,Motion,Motion
221,Energy changes in braking,"When a force is applied to the brakes of a vehicle, there is work done on the friction between the brakes and the wheel. This reduces the kinetic energy of the vehicle, slowing it down and causing the temperature of the brakes to increase.Decelerating from very high speeds too quickly can cause a number of problems:The brakes could overheat and the material they are made from could shatter. This will lead to the driver losing control.Very high temperatures near the tyres could cause the tyres to explode. This will lead to the driver losing control.A high deceleration needs a high force (Newton's second law) and these high forces can seriously injure the driver.Car safety featuresCar safety features such as seatbelts, airbags and crumple zones are all designed to deform (stretch or squash) slowly, which increases the time taken to stop the car. Since the change in speed happens in a longer time, there is less deceleration and, therefore less force required. This also decreases the force of the deceleration on any people within the car. Estimating the forces involved in braking - HigherNewton's second law can be used to estimate the forces involved in braking.70 miles per hour is the same as 31 metres per second. A 50 kg person travelling in a car going at 70 mph is travelling at 31 m/s. In an emergency, it may take 5 seconds to brake the car. The acceleration of the car is given by:\[\text{acceleration} = \frac{\text{change in velocity}}{\text{time}}\]\[\text{acceleration} = \frac{-31}{5}\]= -6.2 m/s2In order to produce this deceleration on the person of 50 kg, the force required is given by:\[\text{F} = \text{ma}\]= 50 _ 6.2= 310 N",Newton's laws,Forces,Motion,Movement and interactions
222,Inertia and momentum _ Higher,"InertiaThe only way to change the velocity of an object is to apply a force over a period of time.In some cases, it takes a long time to change the velocity significantly. In these cases, the object seems reluctant to have it__ speed changed. The tendency of an object to continue in its current state (at rest or in uniform velocity) is called inertia. All objects have inertia. Whether they are moving or not. Inertial massThe ratio of force over acceleration is called inertial mass. Inertial mass is a measure of how difficult it is to change the velocity of an object. The inertial mass can be measured using this rearrangement of Newton's second law:\[\text{m} = \frac{\text{F}}{\text{a}}\]MomentumMomentum is a property of moving objects and is useful when analysing collisions.Momentum is the product of mass and velocity. Momentum is also a vector quantity _ this means it has both a magnitude and an associated direction.For example, an elephant has no momentum when it is standing still. When it begins to walk, it will have momentum in the same direction as it is travelling. The faster the elephant walks, the larger its momentum will be.Calculating momentumMomentum can be calculated using the equation:momentum = mass _ velocity\[\text{p} = \text{mv}\]This is when:momentum (\(\text{p}\)) is measured in kilogram metres per second (kg m/s)velocity (\(\text{v}\)) is measured in metres per second (m/s)mass (\(\text{m}\)) is measured in kilograms (kg)Example A lorry has a mass of 7,500 kg. It travels south at a speed of 25 m/s. Calculate the momentum of the lorry.\[\text{p} = \text{mv}\]= 7,500 _ 25= 187,500 kg m/s (south)QuestionAn ice skater has a mass of 60 kg and travels at a speed of 15 m/s. Calculate the momentum of the skater.Reveal answerupdown\[\text{p} = \text{mv}\]= 60 _ 15= 900 kg m/sConservation of momentumIn a closed system:total momentum before an event = total momentum after the eventA 'closed system' is something that is not affected by external forces. This is called the principle of conservation of momentum. Momentum is conserved in collisions and explosions.Conservation of momentum explains why a gun or cannon recoils backwards when it is fired. When a cannon is fired, the cannon ball gains forward momentum and the cannon gains backward momentum. Before the cannon is fired (the 'event'), the total momentum is zero. This is because neither object is moving. The total momentum of the cannon and the cannon ball after being fired is also zero, with the cannon and cannon ball moving in opposite directions.Calculations involving collisionsCollisions are often investigated using small trolleys. The following diagrams show an example.previousnextpreviousnextBefore collisionpreviousnextAfter collisionYou can use the principle of conservation of momentum to calculate the velocity of the combined trolleys after the collision.Example calculationCalculate the velocity of the trolleys after the collision in the example above.First calculate the momentum of both trolleys before the collision:2 kg trolley = 2 _ 3 = 6 kg m/s4 kg trolley = 8 _ 0 = 0 kg m/sTotal momentum before collision = 6 + 0 = 6 kg m/sTotal momentum (p) after collision = 6 kg m/s (because momentum is conserved)Mass (\(\text{m}\)) after collision = 10 kgNext, rearrange \(\text{p} = \text{mv}\) to find \(\text{v}\):\[\text{v} = \frac{\text{p}}{\text{m}}\]= 6 ÷ 10= 0.6 m/sNote that the 2 kg trolley is travelling to the right before the collision. As its velocity and the calculated velocity after the collision are both positive values, the combined trolleys must also be moving to the right after the collision.

223,Circuit elements,"SymbolsThe following symbols show the different components that can be found in an electrical circuit. ComponentsSome of the common components are:SwitchA switch is used to turn a circuit on (closed) and off (open). LampAn electrical current heats the filament in a bulb so that it gives out light.Fixed resistorA resistor restricts or limits the flow of electrical curent. A fixed resistor has a resistance that does not change.Variable resistorMoving the position of the slider on this resistor, changes the resistance. A variable resistor is used in some dimmer switches and volume controls. ThermistorThe resistance of a thermistor depends on its temperature. At low temperatures, the thermistor has a high resistance. As the temperature increases, the resistance decreases. A thermistor can be used in thermostats or heat activated fire alarms.Light-dependent resistor (LDR)The resistance of an LDR depends on light intensity. At low light levels, the LDR has a high resistance. As the light intensity increases, the resistance decreases. An LDR can be used as a sensor in cameras or automatic lights that come on when it gets dark.Semiconductor diode A semiconductor diode allows current to flow in one direction only. Current will not flow in the other direction. Diodes are used to convert an alternating current (ac) into a direct current (dc).",Circuits,Circuits,Circuits,Circuits
224,Electrical current,"There are two types of current: direct and alternating. In a direct current (dc), the flow of electrons is consistently in one direction around the circuit. In an alternating current (ac), the direction of electron flow continually reverses.ChargeElectrons are negatively charged particles and they transfer energy through wires as electricity.Charge is a property of a body which experiences a force in an electric field. The flow of charge is measured in coulombs (C). Since electrons are so small and one electron will not have much of an effect anywhere, it is more useful to refer to packages of electrons.  One coulomb of charge is a package equivalent to 6,250,000,000,000,000,000 electrons.Currentcurriculum-key-factElectrical current is a flow of electrons. When current flows, electrical work is done and energy transferred.

225,"Current, resistance and potential difference","Potential differenceThe current through a component depends on both the resistance of the component and the potential difference across the component.curriculum-key-factPotential difference is a measure of how much energy is transferred to each Coulomb between two points in a circuitMeasuring potential differenceTo measure the potential difference across a component, a voltmeter must be placed in parallel with that component in order to measure the difference in energy from one side of the component to the other. Potential difference is also known as voltage and is measured in volts (V).ResistanceJonny Nelson explains resistance with a GCSE Physics practical experimentWhen a charge moves through a potential difference, electrical work is done and energy transferred. The potential difference can be calculated using the equation:potential difference = current _ resistance\[\text{V} = \text{I} \times \text R\]This is when:potential difference (\(\text{V}\)) is measured in volts (V)current (\(\text{I}\)) is measured in amps (A)resistance (\(\text{R}\)) is measured in ohms (Ω)One volt is the potential difference when one joule of work is done moving one coulomb of charge.curriculum-key-factConductors have a low resistance.

226,Different resistors,"Carbon resistors have a constant resistance regardless of the conditions in which they are used. However, the resistance of other different materials can be affected in different ways.Variable resistorA variable resistor has its resistance changed by altering the length of material within the resistor. The further the electrons have to travel through the material, the more opportunities there are for collisions between the electrons and the atoms/ions within the material.Filament lampA filament lamp gets hot when a current passes through it. However, as the temperature rises the resistance of the wire increases. This means any extra current passing will require a greater increase in potential difference than before. ThermistorThe resistance of a thermistor depends on its temperature. At low temperatures, the thermistor has a high resistance. As the temperature increases, the resistance decreases. The increased vibrations of the particles within the material knock electrons out of orbitals and, therefore, produce more electrons that are free to move around the material, making it easier for current to flow, reducing resistance.Light-dependent resistor (LDR)The resistance of a LDR depends on light intensity. At low light levels, the LDR has a high resistance. As the light intensity increases, the resistance decreases. LDRs are made of materials (semiconductors) which have electrons knocked out of orbitals when photons of light hit them. In the light, there are more electrons that are free to move around the material, making it easier for current to flow, reducing resistance.Semiconductor diodeA semiconductor diode allows current to flow in one direction only. Current will not flow in the other direction. Diodes are used to convert an alternating current into a direct current.",Circuits,Atomic structure,Circuits,Circuits
227,Required practical - investigating circuit elements,"There are different ways to investigate the relationship between current and potential difference. In this required practical activity, it is important to:measure and observe current and potential differenceuse appropriate apparatus and methods to measure current and potential difference for a resistor, bulb and diodeAim of the experiment:To investigate the relationship between current and potential difference for a resistor, bulb and diode.Method: Connect the circuit as shown in the first diagram.Ensure that the power supply is set to zero at the start.Record the reading on the voltmeter and ammeter.Use the variable resistor to alter the potential difference.Record the new readings on the voltmeter and ammeter.Repeat steps three to four, each time increasing the potential difference slightly.Reverse the power supply connections and repeat steps two to six.Plot a graph of current against potential difference for each component.Repeat the experiment but replace the fixed resistor with a bulb.Fixed resistorResults:Use the circuit diagram below to correctly complete this part of the investigation.For a 10 ohm fixed resistor the results may look like this: Potential difference (V)Current (A)0.50.051.00.101.50.152.00.20......Analysis:When a graph of current against potential difference is plotted, it shows a linear relationship passing through the origin. These graphs are indicators of direct proportionality. Such a relationship means that both variables change in the same way, ie if the potential difference is doubled, the current doubles as a result.
                  Evaluation:For a fixed resistor, the potential difference is directly proportional to the current. Doubling the amount of energy into the resistor results in a current twice as fast through the resistor. This relationship is called Ohm's Law and is true because the resistance of the resistor is fixed and does not change. A resistor is an ohmic conductor.Filament bulbUse the circuit diagram below to correctly complete this part of the investigation.Results:For a filament bulb, the results may look like this: Potential difference (V)Current (A)0.50.101.00.201.50.352.00.502.50.653.00.783.50.904.01.004.51.085.01.155.51.206.01.256.51.317.01.367.51.388.01.418.51.449.01.469.51.4810.01.50Analysis:In this case, the graph shows a non-linear relationship. Current is not proportional to potential difference.
                       Evaluation:In a filament bulb, the current does not increase as fast as the potential difference. Doubling the amount of energy does not cause a current twice as fast. The more energy that is put into the bulb, the harder it is for the current to flow - the resistance of the bulb increases. As the potential difference increases, so does the temperature of the thin wire inside the bulb, the filament. The increased vibrations of the ions in the filament because of the increased temperature make it harder for the electrons to get past.Semiconductor diodeUse the circuit diagram below to correctly investigate the experiment. Method:Connect the circuit as shown in the diagram having chosen a suitable protective resistor (between 100 Ω and 500 Ω).Set the variable resistor to give the lowest potential difference and record the readings on the voltmeter and milliammeter.Alter the variable resistor to increase the potential difference by 0.2 V.Record the new readings on the voltmeter and milliammeter.Repeat steps - three to four, each time increasing the current slightly.Reverse the power supply connections and repeat steps two to six.Plot a graph of current against potential difference for the diode.Results:Potential Difference (V)Current (mA)0.200.400.600.801.001.201.411.631.882.020Analysis:When the graph is plotted this time, it shows that the diode does not allow any current to flow until the potential difference reaches a certain value (usually around 0.7V).
                      Evaluation:A semiconductor diode only allows current to flow in one direction. If the potential difference is arranged to try and push the current the wrong way (also called reverse-bias) no current will flow as the diode's resistance remains very large. Current will only flow if the diode is forward-biased. When forward-biased, the diode's resistance is very large at low potential differences but at higher potential differences, the resistance quickly drops and current begins to flow.

230,Parallel circuits,"In parallel circuits, electrical components are connected alongside one another, forming extra loops.Circuit rulesAn electron will not pass through every component on its way round the circuit. If one of the bulbs is broken then current will still be able to flow round the circuit through the other loop. If one bulb goes out, the other will stay on. Since fewer electrons pass through any loop, they will find it easier to travel and the total resistance of the circuit will be lower than any of the individual resistors in the circuit.Current in parallelSince there are different loops, the current will split as it leaves the cell and pass through one or other of the loops. An ammeter placed in different parts of the circuit will show how the current splits:\[\text I_{1} = \text I_{2} + \text I_{4} = \text I_{3}\]This is when:current (\(\text{I}\)) is measured in amps (A)Potential difference in parallelSince energy has to be conserved, the energy transferred around the circuit by the electrons is the same whichever path the electrons follow. Since potential difference is used to measure changes in energy, the potential difference supplied is equal to the potential differences across each of the parallel components:\[\text V_{s} = \text V_{1} = \text V_{2}\]This is when:potential difference (\(\text{V}\)) is measured in volts (V)Resistors connected in parallelWhen resistors are connected in parallel, we know that the potential difference across each resistor is the same but the current through each resistor adds up to the current through the supply. By having more resistors that are connected in parallel, the more current flows for the same potential difference. If more current flows for the same potential difference, then the resistance has gone down. Overall then, more resistors connected in parallel means less overall resistance.Jonny Nelson introduces an animated explanation of circuits",Circuits,Circuits,Circuits,Circuits

                Car batteries, dry cells and solar cells all provide a direct current (dc) that only flows in one direction.

                Power stations sometimes produce electricity-using magnets. This provides an alternating current (ac). An alternating current is one that changes direction.

232,Mains cables,"PlugsA plug connects a device to the mains electricity supply. The cable between the device and the three-pin plug contains three copper wires that are coated with plastic.Copper wires are good conductors. Plastic is a good insulator.Each wire in the mains cable has an important function:The wire covered in brown plastic is the live wire. This carries the 230 V alternating potential difference from the power supply.The wire covered in blue plastic is the neutral wire and this completes the circuit from the appliance back to the supply. It is usually at 0 V. The wire covered in yellow and green plastic is the earth wire. This is also at 0 V and does not form part of the normal circuit. It is there for safety.EarthingWithout the earth wire if a fault occurs and the live wire becomes loose, there is a danger that it will touch the case. The next person who uses the appliance could get electrocuted. The loose live wire will have made the case 230 V, a person touching the case is also touching the ground and is, therefore, at 0 V. The large potential difference between the hand, on the case, and the feet, on the ground, will push a current through the person's body and shock them.The earth wire is therefore connected to the case and is attached to a metal plate or water pipe underground. As the wire is made of copper, the earth wire provides a low resistance path to the ground. In the event of a fault, the live current passing through the case will follow this path to the ground instead of passing through a person.

This is transferred into kinetic energy in a fan or heat energy in a cooker.The amount of energy transferred depends on the power (the energy transferred each second) and the amount of time the appliance is switched on for. The energy transferred by an appliance can be calculated using the equation:energy = power _ time\[\text{E} = \text P \times \text t\]This is when:energy (\(\text{E}\)) is measured in joules (J)power (\(\text{P}\)) is measured in watts (W)time (\(\text{t}\)) is measured in seconds (s)curriculum-key-factOne watt is the power when one joule of energy is transferred in one second.The equation above is often written with power as the subject.\[\text{power} = \frac{\text{energy}}{\text{time}}\]\[\text{P} = \frac{\text{E}}{\text{t}}\]curriculum-key-factTime should be converted from minutes into seconds - this is done by multiplying the number of minutes by 60.

237,Alternating current and the National Grid,"The National GridThe National Grid distributes electricity across the country. The National Grid connects power stations to homes, workplaces and public buildings all around the country through a system of cables and transformers. The electricity may be produced by a conventional power station turning a generator.TransformersTransformers are used to change voltages and currents in transmission lines. A transformer is formed from two coils of wire around a magnetic core. The number of coils determines whether the transformers will step-up or step-down the voltage. 
                    As the power transferred must stay the same:increasing voltage decreases currentdecreasing voltage increases currentIn the National Grid, a step-up transformer is used to increase the voltage and reduce the current. Less current means less energy is lost through heating the wire which is the main reason for using transformers. The voltage is increased from about 25,000 Volts (V) to 400,000 V causing the current to decrease. To keep people safe from these high voltage wires, pylons are used to support transmission lines above the ground. Before reaching the end user, a step-down transformer, reduces the voltage from the transmission voltage to the safer voltage of 230 V for home use.",Mains electricity,Mains electricity,Mains electricity,Mains electricity

The positive result is a squeaky pop sound as the hydrogen reacts with oxygen in the air in a small explosion.Explaining the reactions of acids with metals - HigherThe reactions of acids with metals are redox reactions.

The concentration of a solution is a measure of how 'crowded' the solute particles are. The more concentrated the solution, the more particles it contains in a given volume.When solutions are described as dilute or concentrated:a dilute solution contains a relatively small amount of dissolved solutea concentrated solution contains a relatively large amount of dissolved soluteTake care to use the word 'dilute' correctly. It can be used as an adjective to describe the concentration of a solution (as here), or as a verb to describe the process of adding more water to a solution to decrease its concentration.Strong and weak acidsAcids in solution are a source of hydrogen ions, H+. The hydrogen ions are produced when the acid dissociates or breaks down to form ions.Strong acidsStrong acids completely dissociate into ions in solution. For example, hydrochloric acid is a strong acid. It ionises completely to form hydrogen ions and chloride ions:HCl(aq) _ H+(aq) + Cl-(aq)Nitric acid and sulfuric acid are also strong acids.Weak acidsWeak acids only partially dissociate in solution. For example, ethanoic acid is a weak acid. It is only partially ionised to form hydrogen ions and ethanoate ions:CH3COOH(aq) _ H+(aq) + CH3COO-(aq)The _ symbol is used in the equation to show that the reaction is a reversible reaction and does not go to completion.pH and hydrogen ion concentrationThe pH of a solution is a measure of its concentration of hydrogen ions:the higher the concentration of H+ ions in an acidic solution, the lower the pHthe lower the concentration of H+ ions in an acidic solution, the higher the pHThis means that, for a given concentration in aqueous solution, the stronger an acid, the lower the pH.The more concentrated the solution of an acid, the lower its pH will be.curriculum-key-factIf the hydrogen ion concentration in a solution increases by a factor of 10, the pH of the solution decreases by 1 unit.pH of alkaline solutionsThe higher the concentration of OH- ions in an alkaline solution, the higher the pH.QuestionA solution of 1 g/dm3 hydrochloric acid has a pH of 1.6.

The method chosen usually depends on the reactants and products involved, and how easy it is to measure changes in them.The mean rate of reaction can be calculated using either of these two equations:\[mean~rate~of~reaction = \frac{quantity~of~reactant~used}{time~taken}\]\[mean~rate~of~reaction = \frac{quantity~of~product~formed}{time~taken}\]Measuring massThe change in mass of a reactant or product can be followed during a reaction. This method is useful when carbon dioxide is a product which leaves the reaction container. It is not suitable for hydrogen and other gases with a small relative formula mass, Mr.The units for rate are usually g/s or g/min.Measuring volumeThe change in volume of a reactant or product can be followed during a reaction. This method is useful when a gas leaves the reaction container. The volume of a gas is measured using a gas syringe, or an upside down burette or measuring cylinder.The units for rate are usually cm3/s or cm3/min.Two ways to measure the volume of a gas produced in a reactionGraphsThe rate of reaction can be analysed by plotting a graph of mass or volume of product formed against time.

However, since the frequency of collisions increases, the frequency of successful collisions also increases.GraphsThe rates of two or more reactions can be compared using a graph of mass or volume of product formed against time. The graph shows this for two reactions.The curved red and green lines are the reaction data. The straight dashed lines at the start of the two reactions are called tangents. They follow the curve at the beginning of the reaction. The steeper the tangent, the faster the reaction.Tangents can also be drawn at other points on the graph. As the reaction carries on, the steepness of the tangent to the curve decreases (eg the blue dashed line) so the reaction is slowing down.Calculating the rate of reaction from the gradient of a tangent - HigherTo calculate the rate at the start of a reaction, you need to find the mathematical gradient (steepness) of the gradient. Use this equation:\[rate~of~reaction = \frac{change~in~mass~or~volume~of~product}{change~in~time}\]For example, using the green tangent below:The green tangent shows lower pressure\[Rate\ of\ reaction\ =\ \frac{60\ cm^{3}}{5\ s}\]Rate of reaction = 12 cm3/s",Rates of reaction,"Energy, rates and reactions",Rates of reaction,Movement and interactions

254,Reaction profiles,"For a chemical reaction to occur between two particles, they must collide with enough energy. The minimum amount of energy needed by particles when they collide in order to cause a reaction is called the activation energy.An energy level diagram shows whether a reaction is exothermic or endothermic. It shows the energy in the reactants and products, and the difference in energy between them.Exothermic reactionThe energy level decreases in an exothermic reaction. This is because energy is given out to the surroundings.A downwards arrow shows that energy is given outEndothermic reactionThe energy level increases in an endothermic reaction. This is because energy is taken in from the surroundings.An upwards arrow shows that energy is taken inIt is usually more helpful to describe how the energy of the chemicals changes during the reaction, so a reaction profile is more useful than an energy level diagram.A reaction profile includes the activation energy, which is the minimum energy needed by particles when they collide for a reaction to occur. The activation energy is shown as a 'hump' in the line, which:starts at the energy of the reactantsis equal to the difference in energy between the top of the __ump_ and the reactantThe overall change in energy in a reaction is the difference between the energy of the reactants and products.Exothermic reactionsThe diagram shows a reaction profile for an exothermic reaction.A reaction profile for an exothermic reactionQuestionDescribe how you can tell from a reaction profile that a reaction is exothermic.Reveal answerupdownIn the profile for an exothermic reaction, the overall change is negative.

255,Catalysts,"A catalyst is a substance that:increases the rate of a reactiondoes not alter the products of the reactionis not chemically changed or used up at the end of the reactionOnly a very small mass of catalyst is needed to increase the rate of a reaction. However, not all reactions have suitable catalysts. Different substances catalyse different reactions. Catalysts do not appear in the overall chemical equation for a reaction.How catalysts workA catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway that has a lower activation energy than the uncatalysed reaction. This does not change the frequency of collisions. However, it does increase the frequency of successful collisions because more particles have energy greater than the activation energy, therefore there are more successful collisions.The effect of a catalyst on the activation energy is shown on a chart called a reaction profile.  This shows how the energy of the reactants and products change during a reaction.A reaction profile for a reaction with and without a catalyst","Energy, rates and reactions","Energy, rates and reactions",Rates of reaction,"Energy, rates and reactions"
256,Enzymes,"Catalysts in biological reactions are called enzymes.Many of the chemical reactions inside the cells of living things would be too slow without enzymes. These reactions occur in the breakdown of chemical molecules, which we see in the digestive system. Enzymes are also involved in the building up of chemical molecules elsewhere in the body.Enzymes are proteins that have a complex 3D shape. Each enzyme has a region called an active site.The substrate - the molecule or molecules taking part in the chemical reaction - fits into the active site. Once bound to the active site, the chemical reaction takes place.In an organism, the active site of each enzyme is a different shape. It is a perfect match to the shape of the substrate molecule, or molecules. This is essential to the enzyme being able to work. One enzyme is therefore specific to one substrate's chemical reaction, or type of chemical reaction.This theory for the way in which enzymes work is called the lock and key theory.Factors affecting enzyme actionPhysical factors affect enzyme activity.TemperatureAt low temperatures, the number of successful collisions between the enzyme and substrate is reduced because their molecular movement decreases. The reaction is slow.The human body is maintained at 37°C as this is the temperature at which the enzymes in our body work best. This not true of the enzymes in all organisms.How temperature affects enzyme actionHigher temperatures disrupt the shape of the active site, which will reduce its activity, or prevent it from working. The enzyme will have been denatured.Enzymes therefore work best at a particular temperature.A graph to show the effect of temperature on enzyme activity:The effect of pHEnzymes are also sensitive to pH. Changing the pH of its surroundings will also change the shape of the active site of an enzyme.Extremes of pH also denature enzymes. The changes are usually, though not always, permanent.Enzymes work inside and outside cells. Cell pH is kept at 7.0 to 7.4 so cellular enzymes will work best within this pH range. Different parts of the digestive system have different pHs. The enzymes that catalyse reactions in each area have an optimum pH that matches the pH of the area. For example, enzymes that work in the stomach have a very low optimum pH because of the acid present.A graph to show the effect of pH on enzyme activity:","Energy, rates and reactions",The digestive system,"Energy, rates and reactions","Energy, rates and reactions"
257,Required practical - effect of pH on the rate of reaction of amylase,"The effect of pH on the rate of reaction of amylaseAimTo determine the rate of the amylase activity  at different pHs.MethodYou will investigate the breakdown of starch by amylase at different pHs.The different pHs under investigation will be produced using buffer solutions. Buffer solutions produce a particular pH, and will maintain it if other substances are added.The amylase will break down the starch.A series of test tubes containing a mixture of starch and amylase is set up at different pHs.A sample is removed from the test tubes every 10 seconds to test for the presence of starch. Iodine solution will turn a blue/black colour when starch is present, so when all the starch is broken down, a blue-black colour is no longer produced. The iodine solution will remain orange-brown.A control experiment must be set up - without the amylase - to make sure that the starch would not break down anyway, in its absence. The result of the control experiment must be negative - the colour must remain blue-black - for results with the enzyme to be valid.When the starch solution is added:start timing immediatelyremove a sample immediately, and test it with iodine solutionsample the starch-amylase mixture continuously, for example every 10 secondsThis is how you might set up the experiment:For each pH investigated, record the time taken for the disappearance of starch, eg when the iodine solution in the spotting tile remains orange-brown.HazardsHazardPossible harmPossible precautionAmylase solutionMay cause allergic reactionsAvoid contact with skin and eyesIodine solutionIt is an irritantWear safety goggles, avoid contact with skin and eyesExample resultspHTime for starch to disappear (s)51206407308509150The time taken for the disappearance of starch is not the rate of reaction.It will give an indication of the rate, but it is the inverse of the rate - the shorter the time taken, the greater the rate of the reaction.The rate of the reaction can be calculated by dividing the number one by the time taken in seconds. The calculation is therefore 1/t.For example, for the pH 5 investigation, the calculation would be:1/120 = 0.0083So, from the results:pHTime for starch to disappear (s)Rate of starch breakdown (1/t)51200.00836400.02507300.03338500.020091500.0067Plot a graph of rate of reaction against pH.A similar experiment can be carried out to investigate the effect of temperature on amylase activity.Set up a series of test tubes in the same way and maintain these at different temperatures using a water bath - either electrical or a heated beaker of water.Depending on the chemical reaction under investigation, you might monitor the reaction in a different way. If investigating the effect of temperature on the breakdown of lipid by lipase, for instance, you could monitor pH change - lipids are broken down into fatty acids and glycerol. As the reaction proceeded, the release of fatty acids would mean that the pH would decrease.","Energy, rates and reactions",The digestive system,Rates of reaction,Movement and interactions

They can be represented in the following way:A + B _ C + DThe symbol _ has two half arrowheads, one pointing in each direction. It is used in equations that show reversible reactions:the forward reaction is the one that goes to the rightthe backward reaction is the one that goes to the leftThe reaction mixture may contain reactants and products, and their proportions may be changed by altering the reaction conditions.An exampleAmmonium chlorideAmmonium chloride is a white solid. It breaks down when heated, forming ammonia and hydrogen chloride.

261,Changing the position of equilibrium - Higher,"This video looks at reversible reactions and dynamic equilibriumThe equilibrium position of a reversible reaction is a measure of the concentrations of the reacting substances at equilibrium.Factors that affect the position of equilibriumThe equilibrium position can be changed by changing the reaction conditions through:changing the pressurechanging the concentrationchanging the temperatureWhen a change is made to a system at equilibrium, the position of equilibrium moves to counteract the change that was made. For example, if the temperature is increased, the position of equilibrium moves in the endothermic direction to reduce the temperature.For AQA GCSE Combined Science (Synergy), the specifics of the Haber process don__ need to be known. However, an understanding of these general principles and an ability to apply them to a reaction similar to the Haber process is still needed.Background to the Haber processNitrogen gas is reacted with hydrogen gas to make ammonia gas. The forward reaction is exothermic.N2(g) + 3H2(g) _ 2NH3(g)The equilibrium position is:to the left if the concentrations of N2 and H2 are greater than the concentration of NH3to the right if the concentration of NH3 is greater than the concentrations of N2 and H2Changing the pressureIf the pressure is increased in a reaction involving gases, the equilibrium position moves in the direction of the fewest molecules of gas, to reduce the pressure.There are fewer molecules on the right-hand side of the equation for the Haber process:N2(g) + 3H2(g) _ 2NH3(g)(1 + 3) = 4 molecules _ 2 moleculesIf the pressure is increased, the equilibrium position moves to the right.QuestionSulfur dioxide reacts with oxygen to make sulfur trioxide in a reversible reaction: 2SO2(s) + O2(g) _ 2SO3(g)Predict the effect of increasing the pressure.Reveal answerupdownThe equilibrium position will move to the right, in the direction of the fewest molecules of gas.Changing the temperatureIn a reversible reaction, if the reaction is exothermic in one direction, it is endothermic in the other direction. If the temperature is increased, the equilibrium position moves in the direction of the endothermic process.For example, in the Haber process:N2(g) + 3H2(g) _ 2NH3(g) (forward reaction is exothermic)If the forward reaction is exothermic, the backward reaction must be endothermic. Therefore, if the temperature is increased, the equilibrium position moves in the endothermic direction (to the left) to reduce the temperature. This means that less ammonia (NH3) will be produced.QuestionHydrogen can be manufactured by reacting carbon with steam:C(s) + H2O(g) _ H2(g) + CO(g) (forward reaction is endothermic)Predict the effect of increasing the temperature.Reveal answerupdownThe equilibrium position will move to the right, in the direction of the endothermic reaction.Changing the concentrationIf the concentration of a reactant (on the left) is increased, the equilibrium position moves in the direction away from this reactant, and so more of the products are produced (on the right). If one of the products is removed from a reaction (on the right), then the position of equilibrium moves to the right to make more of that product.For example, bismuth chloride reacts with water in a reversible reaction:BiCl3(aq) + H2O(l) _ BiOCl(s) + 2HCl(aq)The concentration of hydrochloric acid can be increased by adding more hydrochloric acid. When this happens, the equilibrium position moves to the left, away from HCl(aq) in the equation.QuestionIron(III) ions react with thiocyanate ions, SCN-, in a reversible reaction:Fe3+(aq) + SCN-(aq) _ FeSCN2+(aq)Predict the effect of adding more iron(III) ions.Reveal answerupdownThe equilibrium position will move to the right, in the direction away from Fe3+ in the equation.",Equilibria,"Energy, rates and reactions",Equilibria,Combined Science

This is because magnesium displaced copper and iron, iron displaced copper only, but copper could not displace magnesium or iron.QuestionExplain why three combinations of metal and salt solution were not done in the investigation.Reveal answerupdownA metal cannot displace itself from a solution of one of its salts. There would be no reaction, so these combinations were not done.Writing ionic equations for displacement reactions - HigherA balanced equation for the reaction between magnesium and copper sulfate solution is:Mg(s) + CuSO4(aq) _ MgSO4(aq) + Cu(s)It can be written in terms of the ions involved:Mg(s) + Cu2+(aq) + SO42-(aq) _ Mg2+(aq) + SO42-(aq) + Cu(s)Sulfate ions, SO42-, appear on both sides of the equation, but they do not take part in the reaction.

266,Required practical - investigate the electrolysis of aqueous solutions,"Investigating the electrolysis of aqueous solutions using inert electrodesThis required practical involves developing a hypothesis. This is also an opportunity to use appropriate apparatus and techniques to draw, set up and use electrochemical cells to monitor chemical reactions, produce elements from compounds and to identify gases.Developing the hypothesisAn investigation starts with a scientific question, for example:What are the products of electrolysis of aqueous solutions?Is there a pattern in the products of electrolysis of aqueous solutions?The first step in answering a scientific question is to develop a hypothesis. A hypothesis is an idea to be tested, which is backed up by scientific knowledge. Suitable hypotheses are:a non-metal will be produced at the positive electrode because non-metal ions are negativesolutions that include ions of metals that are low in the reactivity series produce the metal at the negative electrode (not hydrogen) because ions of unreactive metals have a greater tendency to gain electronsThe hypothesis can then be used to make predictions, such as 'In the hydrolysis of copper chloride, the product at the positive electrode will be chlorine.'Planning the investigationThe plan needs to address these points:which apparatus to use, and a diagram showing how it will be set upwhich solutions to testhow to test for, and identify, the products of electrolysisa consideration of hazards, risks and precautionsApparatusThe set up below is suitable. The positive electrode is connected to the positive terminal of a DC power pack. The negative electrode is connected to the negative terminal of the power pack.Test solutionsIt is best to test at least five solutions. Suitable solutions include copper sulfate, copper chloride, sodium chloride, sodium nitrate, sodium bromide. There are many more.Identifying the productsAny gases produced can be collected in the test tubes. They need to be stoppered and tested later. Gas tests include:hydrogen - lighted splint goes out with a squeaky popoxygen - a glowing splint relightschlorine - damp blue litmus paper turns red and is then bleached whiteThe electrodes need to be examined carefully each time, to see if a metal has been deposited on them.QuestionIn an electrolysis cell, a gas that bleached litmus paper was produced at the anode.

267,Oxidation and reduction in electrolysis - Higher,"Oxidation and reductionOxidation and reduction can be described in terms of electrons:oxidation  is the loss of electronsreduction is the gain of electronsIt helps to remember OIL RIG _ Oxidation Is Loss of electrons, Reduction Is Gain of electrons.Half equationsA half equation is used to represent the reaction that happens at an electrode during electrolysis. It shows what happens when ions gain or lose electrons. In half equations:electrons are shown as e-the numbers of atoms of each element must be the same on both sidesthe total charge on each side must be the same (usually zero)Cathode reactionsPositively charged ions gain electrons at the cathode. These are half equations for some reactions at the cathode:Na+ + e- _ NaPb2+ + 2e- _ Pb2H+ + 2e- _ H2All of the half equations occurring at the cathode show electrons being gained, so they all show reduction taking place. The positive ions on the left of each half equation are being reduced.Worked exampleBalance the half equation for the formation of aluminium during electrolysis: Al3+ + e- _ Al.The balanced half equation is: Al3+ + 3e- _ Al (because three negatively charged electrons are needed to balance the three positive charges on the aluminium ion).QuestionWrite a balanced half equation for the formation of calcium from a calcium ion, Ca2+.Reveal answerupdownCa2+ + 2e- _ CaAnode reactionsNegatively charged ions lose electrons at the anode.

268,Diamond and graphite,"Diamond and graphite are different forms of the element carbon. They both have giant structures of carbon atoms, joined together by covalent bonds. However, their structures are different so some of their properties are different.DiamondStructure and bondingDiamond is a giant covalent structure in which:each carbon atom is joined to four other carbon atoms by strong covalent bondsthe carbon atoms form a regular tetrahedral network structurethere are no free electronsCarbon atoms in diamond form a tetrahedral arrangementProperties and usesThe rigid network of carbon atoms, held together by strong covalent bonds, makes diamond very hard. This makes it useful for cutting tools, such as diamond-tipped glass cutters and oil rig drills.Diamond has a very high melting point because a lot of energy is required to break the strong covalent bonds between the atoms. It does not conduct electricity because it has no free electrons.GraphiteStructure and bondingGraphite has a giant covalent structure in which:each carbon atom forms three covalent bonds with other carbon atomsthe carbon atoms form layers of hexagonal ringsthere are no covalent bonds between the layersthere is one non-bonded - or delocalised - electron from each atomDotted lines represent the weak forces between the layers in graphiteProperties and usesGraphite has delocalised electrons, just like metals. These electrons are free to move between the layers in graphite, so graphite can conduct electricity. This makes graphite useful for electrodes in batteries and for       
              electrolysis.The forces between the layers in graphite are weak. This means that the layers can slide over each other. This makes graphite slippery, so it is useful as a lubricant.QuestionExplain why diamond does not conduct electricity and why graphite does conduct electricity.Reveal answerupdownDiamond does not conduct electricity because it has no charged particles that are free to move. Graphite does conduct electricity because it has delocalised electrons which move between the layers.",Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Groups in the periodic table,Carbon chemistry
269,Graphene and fullerenes,"Graphene and fullerenes are forms of carbon. Their structures are different from those of diamond and graphite, which are also forms of carbon.GrapheneGraphene is a single layer of graphite and is one atom thick. The strong covalent bonds between the carbon atoms mean that graphene:has a very high melting pointis very strongLike graphite, graphene conducts electricity well because it has delocalised electrons that are free to move across its surface.These properties make graphene useful in electronics and for making composites.curriculum-key-factGraphene has a giant covalent structure, but fullerenes have large molecules.FullerenesFullerenes are molecules of carbon atoms with hollow shapes. Their structures are based on hexagonal rings of carbon atoms joined by covalent bonds. Some fullerenes include rings with five or seven carbon atoms. Two examples of fullerenes are buckminsterfullerene and nanotubes.BuckminsterfullereneBuckminsterfullerene was the first fullerene to be discovered. Its molecules are made up of 60 carbon atoms joined together by strong covalent bonds. Molecules of C60 are spherical.There are weak intermolecular forces between molecules of buckminsterfullerene. These need little energy to overcome, so buckminsterfullerene is slippery and has a low melting point.Buckminsterfullerene has sixty carbon atoms joined by covalent bondsNanotubesA nanotube is like a layer of graphene, rolled into a cylinder. The length of a nanotube is very long compared to its width, so nanotubes have high length to diameter ratios.Nanotubes have high tensile strength, so they are strong in tension and resist being stretched. Like graphene, nanotubes are strong and conduct electricity because they have delocalised electrons.These properties make nanotubes useful for nanotechnology, electronics and specialised materials.Nanotubes can be several millimetres long but only a few nanometres wide",Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry
270,Crude oil and hydrocarbons,"Hydrocarbons are compounds that contain hydrogen and carbon atoms only.Crude oilCrude oil is a finite resource that is found in the Earth's crust. It is the remains of organisms that lived and died millions of years ago - mainly plankton which was buried in mud.Crude oil is a complex mixture of hydrocarbons. The carbon atoms in these molecules are joined together in chains and rings. In the ball and stick models below, carbon atoms are black and hydrogen atoms are white.Some examples of hydrocarbon moleculesCrude oil is an important source of:fuels such as petrol, diesel, kerosene, heavy fuel oil and liquefied petroleum gasesfeedstock for the petrochemical industryA feedstock is a raw material used to provide reactants for an industrial reaction. A petrochemical is a substance made from crude oil using chemical reactions. For example, ethene is produced from crude oil. It is used as feedstock to make poly(ethene), a polymer.Other useful substances made from compounds found in crude oil include:solventslubricantsdetergents",Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Covalent bonding
271,Alkanes,"The alkanes form a homologous series. Like all homologous series, the alkanes:have the same general formulashow a gradual variation in physical properties, such as their boiling pointshave similar chemical propertiesGeneral formulaThe general formula for the alkanes is CnH2n+2, where n is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule.Worked exampleDecane is an alkane. Its molecules contain 10 carbon atoms. Predict the molecular formula of decane and explain your answer.The formula will be C10H22. This is because n = 10. So, 2n + 2 = (2 _ 10) + 2 = 20 + 2 = 22.QuestionHexane is an alkane. Its molecules contain six carbon atoms. Predict the molecular formula of
hexane.Reveal answerupdownThe formula will be C6H14.StructuresThe table shows four alkanes, their molecular formulae and their structures.Table showing four alkanes, their molecule formulae and their structuresThe ball and stick models on the right show that the covalent bonds are not really at angles of 90°, as shown in the structures.The alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons:Hydrocarbons, because they are compounds containing hydrogen and carbon only.Saturated, because they only contain single bonds. Each atom has formed its maximum number of bonds.",Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Groups in the periodic table,Covalent bonding
272,Separating crude oil,"Fran Scott explains fractional distillation - the separation of crude oil into fractionsFractional distillation is used to separate crude oil into simpler, more useful mixtures. This method can be used because different hydrocarbons have different boiling points.Fractional distillationDuring the fractional distillation of crude oil:heated crude oil enters a tall fractionating column, which is hot at the bottom and gets cooler towards the topvapours from the oil rise through the columnvapours condense when they become cool enoughliquids are led out of the column at different heightsSmall hydrocarbon molecules have weak intermolecular forces, so they have low boiling points. They do not condense, but leave the column as gases. Long hydrocarbon molecules have stronger intermolecular forces, so they have high boiling points. They leave the column as hot liquid bitumen.Crude oil fractionsThe different, useful mixtures are called fractions. This is because they are only part of the original crude oil.Crude oil fractions and their usescurriculum-key-factOne way to remember the names of the fractions is: Lazy Penguins Keep Drinking Hot Beverages. (Liquefied petroleum gases, Petrol, Kerosene, Diesel, Heavy fuel oil, Bitumen.)",Carbon chemistry,Water,States of matter,States of matter
273,Properties of fractions,"Each crude oil fraction contains a mixture of hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbons in a fraction are mostly hydrocarbons called alkanes. They have similar (but not identical):numbers of hydrogen and carbon atoms in their moleculesboiling pointsease of ignitionviscosityFor example, the gases fraction contains hydrocarbons with one to four carbon atoms. These:have boiling points below room temperatureare very flammablehave a low viscosityThe hydrocarbons in different fractions differ in these properties. For example, the bitumen fraction contains hydrocarbons with more than 35 carbon atoms. These have:boiling points well above room temperatureare very difficult to ignitehave a high viscosityHydrocarbon fuels can undergo complete combustion or incomplete combustion, depending on the amount of oxygen available.Complete combustionComplete combustion of a hydrocarbon fuel happens when there is a good supply of air. Carbon and hydrogen atoms in the fuel react with oxygen and are oxidised in an exothermic reaction:carbon dioxide and water are producedthe maximum amount of energy is given outIn a Bunsen burner, this occurs when the air hole is fully open.A Bunsen burner blue flameIn general:hydrocarbon + oxygen _ carbon dioxide + waterHere are the equations for the complete combustion of propane, used in bottled gas:propane + oxygen _ carbon dioxide + waterC3H8 + 5O2 _ 3CO2 + 4H2OQuestionWrite a word and balanced symbol equation for the complete combustion of methane, CH4, found in natural gas.Reveal answerupdownMethane + oxygen _ carbon dioxide + waterCH4 + 2O2 _ CO2 + 2H2O",Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Photosynthesis,Carbon chemistry
274,Cracking and alkenes,"Cracking is a reaction in which larger saturated hydrocarbon molecules are broken down into smaller, more useful hydrocarbon molecules, some of which are unsaturated:the original starting hydrocarbons are alkanesthe products of cracking include alkanes and alkenes, members of a different homologous seriesFor example, hexane can be cracked to form butane and ethene:hexane _ butane + etheneC6H14 _ C4H10 + C2H4The total number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the products is the same as in the starting alkane.QuestionC16H34 is an alkane which can be used as the starting chemical in cracking. One of the products of cracking this compound is an alkane which has 10 carbon atoms in it. Write a balanced symbol equation for this cracking reaction.Reveal answerupdownC16H34 _ C10H22 + C6H12Various methods can be used for cracking, eg catalytic cracking and steam cracking:Catalytic cracking uses a temperature of approximately 550°C and a catalyst known as a zeolite which contains aluminium oxide and silicon oxideSteam cracking uses a higher temperature of approximately 550°C and no catalystThe slideshow describes the process of catalytic cracking.previousnextpreviousnext1. The structure of hexanepreviousnext2. The hexane is passed over a hot catalystpreviousnext3. Butane and ethene are producedReasons for crackingCracking is important for two main reasons:it helps to match the supply of fractions with the demand for themit produces alkenes, which are useful as feedstock for the petrochemical industrySupply and demandThe supply is how much of a fraction an oil refinery produces. The demand is how much of a fraction customers want to buy. Very often, fractional distillation of crude oil produces more of the larger hydrocarbons than can be sold, and less of the smaller hydrocarbons than customers want.Smaller hydrocarbons are more useful as fuels than larger hydrocarbons. Since cracking converts larger hydrocarbons into smaller hydrocarbons, the supply of fuels is improved. This helps to match supply with demand.AlkenesAlkanes and alkenes both form homologous series of hydrocarbons, but:alkanes are saturated, their carbon atoms are only joined by C-C single bondsalkenes are unsaturated, they contain at least one C=C double bondAs a result, alkenes are more reactive than alkanes. Alkenes can take part in reactions that alkanes cannot. For example, ethene molecules can react together to form poly(ethene), a polymer.Alkenes will react with bromine water and turn it from orange/brown to colourless. This is the way to test for a double C=C bond in a molecule.",Carbon chemistry,Carbon chemistry,Groups in the periodic table,Carbon chemistry
275,Extracting iron and copper,"Reactions of metals with oxygenMany metals react with oxygen to make metal oxides. For example, magnesium burns rapidly in air:Magnesium + oxygen _ magnesium oxide2Mg(s) + O2(g) _ 2MgO(s)The reactions are oxidation reactions because the metal gains oxygen.Oxygen can be removed from metal oxides in chemical reactions. For example:Zinc oxide + carbon _ zinc + carbon dioxide 2ZnO(s) + C _ 2Zn(s) + CO2(g)In this reaction, carbon is oxidised because it gains oxygen. At the same time, copper oxide is reduced because oxygen is removed from it.curriculum-key-factOxidation is the gain of oxygen. Reduction is the loss of oxygen.OresUnreactive metals such as gold are found in the Earth's crust as the uncombined elements. However, most metals are found combined with other elements to form compounds. Chemical reactions are needed to extract metals from their compounds.Most metals are extracted from ores found in the Earth's crust.  An ore is a rock that contains enough of a metal or a metal compound to make extracting the metal worthwhile.Extracting copperThe extraction method used depends upon the metal's position in the reactivity series.If a metal is less reactive than carbon, it can be extracted from its compounds by heating with carbon. Copper is an example of this. Molten copper can be produced from copper oxide by heating with carbon:Copper oxide + carbon _ copper + carbon dioxide2CuO(s) + C(s) _ 2Cu(l) + CO2(g)Metal oxide  +  carbon  _ metal  +  carbon dioxideFor example, Copper oxide is reduced as carbon is oxidised, so this is an example of a redox reaction.The table summarises the extraction methods used for different metals. Although an unreactive metal is found as the metal itself, chemical reactions are often needed to remove other elements that might contaminate it.Extracting ironIron(III) oxide is reduced to molten iron when it reacts with carbon. One of the products is carbon monoxide:iron(III) oxide + carbon _ iron + carbon monoxideFe2O3(s) + 3CO(g) _ 2Fe(l) + 3CO2(g)This method of extraction works because carbon is more reactive than iron, so it can displace iron from iron compounds. Extracting a metal by heating with carbon is cheaper than using electrolysis.QuestionIn the reaction of iron(III) oxide with carbon, state which substance is reduced and which substance is oxidised.Reveal answerupdownCarbon gains oxygen, so it is oxidised. Iron(III) oxide loses oxygen, so it is reduced.",Material resources,The periodic table,The periodic table,Electrons and chemical reactions
276,Extracting aluminium,"Aluminium is more reactive than carbon so it must be extracted from its compounds using electrolysis. Even though aluminium is more abundant than iron in the Earth's crust, aluminium is more expensive than iron. This is mainly because of the large amounts of electrical energy used in the extraction process.Electrolysis of aluminium oxideThe electrolyteAluminium ore is treated to produce pure aluminium oxide. The electrolytes used in electrolysis are ionic compounds:in the molten state, ordissolved in waterAluminium oxide is insoluble in water, so it must be molten to act as an electrolyte. However, the melting point of aluminium oxide is high. A lot of energy must be transferred to break its strong ionic bonds, and this is expensive. To reduce costs, powdered aluminium oxide is dissolved in molten cryolite. Cryolite melts at a lower temperature than aluminium oxide, reducing costs. However, significant amounts of energy are still required to melt cryolite.The electrolysis processThe diagram shows an electrolysis cell used to extract aluminium. Both electrodes are made of graphite, a form of carbon with a high melting point and which conducts electricity.A cross section through an electrolysis cellDuring electrolysis:at the cathode, aluminium ions gain electrons and form aluminium atomsat the anode, oxide ions lose electrons and form oxygen gasThe oxygen reacts with the carbon anodes, forming carbon dioxide. So the anodes gradually wear away. They must be replaced frequently, adding to the cost of producing aluminium.",Material resources,Electrons and chemical reactions,Groups in the periodic table,Electrons and chemical reactions
277,Life-cycle assessment,"A life-cycle assessment or LCA is an analysis of the impact of a manufactured product on the environment for its lifetime. There are many detailed stages but the main ones are:extracting and processing the raw materials neededmanufacturing the product and its packagingusing the product during its lifetimedisposing of the product at the end of its useful lifeThe four main stagesAt all stages, an LCA is likely to include information about the use of energy, transport of materials and the release of waste substances into the environment.1. Raw materialsAll the raw materials we need come from the Earth's crust, atmosphere or oceans, or are due to living organisms. Obtaining these materials has an impact on the environment, including:using up limited resources such as ores and crude oildamaging habitats through quarrying, mining, or felling trees2. ManufactureThe manufacture of products has an impact on the environment, including:using up land for factoriesthe use of machines and people3. UseThe impact of a product on the environment during its use depends on the type of product. For example, a wooden chair has very little impact, unless it needs cleaning or repair. On the other hand, using a car will have a significant impact.4. DisposalThe disposal of old products has an impact on the environment, including:using up land for landfill siteswhether any or all of the product can be recycled or reusedFour main stages of the life-cycle assessmentWorked exampleQuestionThe table shows some data about the energy needed in the lifetime of a pillow case.Life cycle stageLifetime energy use (%)Raw materials 10Manufacture 15Use70Disposal5Discuss the use of energy during the lifetime of the pillowcase. Describe one way in which the energy use could be significantly reduced.Reveal answerupdownOne quarter of the energy use is associated with making the pillowcase, and very little in disposing of it. The greatest use of energy happens when it is being used, probably because of washing, drying and ironing the pillowcase. Energy use could be reduced by drying it outside and without ironing it, and washing it at a lower temperature.Comparative LCAsComparative LCAs can be used to evaluate which of two alternative products will have a lower negative impact on the environment. For example, a comparision between plastic carrier bags and paper carrier bags can be made:Life cycle stage Plastic carrier bagsPaper carrier bagsRaw materialsCrude oil is a finite resource; fractional distillation, cracking and polymerisation all require a lot of energy.Can be made from recycled paper, or from trees. Making paper from trees requires more energy than recycling paper but much less than making plastics.ManufactureCheaper to make large quantities of bags from plastic.More expensive to make bags from paper because the handles must be glued on.UseLower impact on the environment because plastic bags are usually stronger so they can be reused many times.Relatively short lifetime; can only be reused a limited number of times.DisposalCan sometimes be collected and recycled; if disposed of as litter, they do not biodegrade; in landfill, may take decades or centuries to degrade.Can be recycled easily; if disposed of in landfill, they biodegrade quickly.Criticisms of LCAsIt is sometimes easy to work out accurate numerical values for parts of a LCA. For example, we can measure the amount of energy needed to manufacture a product, or the amount of carbon dioxide produced by transporting raw materials. However, some parts of a LCA require judgements, such as the effect of pollutants. This means that completing a LCA is not a totally objective process and different people might come up with different judgements.It is important to consider who has completed the LCA and whether they have any bias. For example, if the LCA is completed by the company which is making and selling a product, they might only include some parts of the genuine environmental impact.",Material resources,Rates of reaction,States of matter,Material resources
278,Recycling,"Metals, glass, building materials, clay ceramics and most plastics are made from limited natural resources. Some items made from these materials can be reused. This saves the most energy and reduces the impact on the environment. For example, glass bottles only need to be washed and sterilised before they can be filled again. Other products cannot be reused in this way but they can be recycled.Advantages of recyclingThe advantages of recycling compared to producing materials and objects from natural resources
include:fewer quarries and mines are needed to extract finite reserves of metal oresless crude oil needs to be extracted from the crust as a raw material for making plasticsless energy is needed for recycling compared with making a new product from natural resources, so the emission of greenhouse gases is reducedthe amount of waste that is disposed of in landfill is reducedWorked exampleQuestionThe table shows the percentage of energy saved by recycling compared to extraction from a metal ore.Metal Energy saved (%)Iron70Aluminium92Suggest an explanation for the difference.Reveal answerupdownAluminium is extracted from its ore using electrolysis but iron is extracted by heating with carbon. Electrolysis uses more energy, so more energy is used to extract aluminium in the first place. Aluminium has a lower melting point than iron, so less energy is needed to melt it during recycling.Disadvantages of recyclingDisadvantages of recycling arise from the recycling process itself:the collection and transport of used items needs organisation, workers, vehicles and fuelit can be difficult to sort different metals from one anotherthe sorted metal may need to be transported to where it can be melted and cooled to form new productsThe amount of sorting required depends on the purity of the mixture of metals/materials, and also on how pure the final recycled metal needs to be. For example, copper for electrical wiring requires a very high purity, so if wiring is made from recycled copper, the waste copper will need processing before being melted again into copper for wiring.However, steel used in construction doesn't need such a high purity. This means that scrap iron can easily be added to the steel furnace when steel is being made. This reduces the cost of making steel from iron ore.QuestionDescribe a simple way to separate aluminium from iron.Reveal answerupdownA magnet or electromagnet will attract iron but not aluminium.",Material resources,The periodic table,Metals,Combined Science
279,Biological methods of metal extraction - Higher,"The Earth's supply of metal ores is limited. For example, high-grade copper ores, which contain a high percentage of copper, are becoming harder to find and mine. There are some alternative methods to extract metals from low-grade copper ores that use living organisms. These have advantages and disadvantages compared to the usual extraction methods.Phytoextraction (phytomining)Plants absorb mineral ions through their roots. Phytoextraction makes use of this:plants are grown in soil that contains low grade orethe plants absorb metal ions through their roots and concentrate these ions in their cellsthe plants are harvested and burntthe ash left behind contains metal compoundsPhytoextraction is slow but it:reduces the need to obtain new ore by miningconserves limited supplies of high-grade oresreduces the amount of rock waste that must be disposed of after traditional miningWorked exampleSuggest reasons why phytoextraction reduces damage to the environment.Mining for metal ores involves quarries which are large holes in the ground. These create noise, dust and traffic. They also destroy natural habitats. Phytoextraction reduces the need for mining and reduces this damage.QuestionGive one disadvantage of phytoextraction.Reveal answerupdownIt is a slow process.BioleachingCertain bacteria can break down low-grade ores to produce an acidic solution containing copper ions. The solution is called a leachate and the process is called bioleaching.Bioleaching does not need high temperatures but it:produces toxic substances, including sulfuric acid, which damage the environmentProcessing the metal compoundsIron is more reactive than copper. It can displace copper from the leachate. For example:iron + copper sulfate _ iron(II) sulfate + copperFe(s) + CuSO4(aq) _ FeSO4(aq) + Cu(s)Since iron is cheaper than copper, the use of scrap iron is a cost-effective way to produce copper from the leachate.Alternatively, the copper compounds can be dissolved and the solution electrolysed to produce copper metal.",Material resources,Transport into and out of cells,Transport into and out of cells,Electrons and chemical reactions

281,Comparing energy resources ,"There are different energy resources in the world and the amount of energy stored by them varies greatly. For example, the nuclear energy within 1 kg of uranium contains a very large amount of energy, but the gravitational potential energy stored by many thousands of tonnes of water held back by a dam contains less.Fossil fuels Fossil fuels are a chemical store of energy and include coil, oil and natural gas. Most of the UK's electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, mainly natural gas (30% in 2015) and coal (23%). A very small amount is produced from oil (under 1%). Using fossil fuels to produce electricityFossil fuel is burnt to boil water and turn it into steam.The steam rises past turbines and causes them to spin.The turbines are connected to generators which are spun to generate electricity.Transformers are used to step up the voltage before feeding the electricity into the National Grid.Transformers are used to step down the voltage before feeding electricity into homes.Advantages and disadvantages of fossil fuel powerAdvantagesDisadvantagesReadily available (at the moment)Non-renewable source _ will eventually run outRelatively easy to produce energy from themIncreasing fuel costsRelease carbon dioxide (CO2 ) when burnt _ greenhouse gasRelease sulphur dioxide (SO2 ) when burnt _ acid rainNuclear powerElectricity is generated in nuclear power stations using a fission reactor powered by uranium fuel. 22% of the UK's electricity is generated using nuclear fission.

282,Comparing renewable sources of energy,"Energy from plantsBiofuels are fuels made from plant materials. These include biodiesel, made from plant oils, and bioethanol, made by fermenting sugar and wheat.Advantages and disadvantages of biofuelAdvantagesDisadvantagesRenewable source.Uses land that could be used to grow food.Less carbon emissions. When burned, they release as much carbon as they absorbed during growth, although some carbon dioxide will be released during production, eg by the tractor.Needs a lot of labour.Reduce our reliance on fossil fuels.Bioethanol cannot be used in cars without modifying the engine.Energy from the windHumans have been taking advantage of the wind for thousands of years. Sailing ships and windmills are both examples of wind power.   Even though sailing ships are still used today, the major use of wind is to generate electricity using wind turbines.The turbine consists of a generator in a nacelle at the top of a high tower. The wind turns the blades of the turbine and these, in turn, spin the generator.Advantages and disadvantages of wind powerAdvantagesDisadvantagesRenewable sourceExpensive to buildCheap to run (no fuel costs)Visual pollution (spoils the view)No polluting gases producedNoise pollution (very noisy)Unreliable (depends on the strength of the wind)Energy from falling waterEnergy in the gravitational store of a body of water held above sea level can be used as the water is allowed to run down pipes containing turbines. There are two ways of doing this:TidalThe Moon's gravitational pull lifts the level of the seas twice a day and this is the force that gives us tidal power. 
            At high tide, the sea is trapped behind a barrage/dam.The water is allowed to run out through pipes that lead back to the sea.As the water runs through the pipes it spins turbines that are linked to generators.HydroelectricWater is held behind a dam in a lake or reservoir high up a mountain.Rivers or rainfall fills the reservoir.When energy is needed, the water is allowed to run down through pipes to another lake lower down the mountain.As the water runs through the pipes it spins turbines that are linked to generators.The water can be pumped back up during the night when electricity is cheaper.Advantages and disadvantages of water powerAdvantagesDisadvantagesRenewable sourceVisual pollution (spoils the view)Cheap to run (no fuel costs)Damage to the estuary habitatsNo polluting gases producedDamage to valley habitats by floodingVery reliableCan block access to ports for shippingCan be switched on when neededTrapped and rotting vegetation can produce greenhouse gases such as methaneEnergy from the SunAll our energy comes from the Sun. The Sun warms the air and sets up convection currents that causes the wind. This evaporates water from seas and lakes to set up the water cycle to provide the rain that fills the reservoirs. We can also make use of the energy from the Sun directly using solar cells or solar panels.
        
        Solar PanelsThe panels are fitted on a roof. Infrared radiation from the Sun shines through the glass lid and heats the water in the pipes.Solar cellsA solar cell is a circuit component that uses light from the Sun to generate electricity.

283,A national record,"For the first time in history, on Wednesday 7 June 2017, more energy was generated in the UK using the alternative sources of wind, solar and hydroelectricity than was generated using fossil fuels.All types of energy resources are used to meet the demands of the UK consumers. It is not unusual for this demand to reach 30 GW at any time during the day.curriculum-key-fact1 GW = 1,000 MW = 1,000,000 kW = 1,000,000,000 W30 GW is the equivalent of 15,000,000 electric kettles all being turned on at once!The typical output of a power station may be:Energy sourceApproximate output per station (GW)Coal power station_ 1.5Gas power station_ 0.5Nuclear power station_ 1.3Wind turbine_ 0.004Tidal barrage_ 2Solar farm_ 0.1Renewable  sources either produce much less energy than traditional power stations or require particular geography.QuestionHow many wind turbines are needed to replace one average coal power station?Reveal answerupdownCoal power station = 1.5 GWWind turbine = 0.004 GW1.5 ÷ 0.004 = 375375 wind turbines provide the equivalent to one coal power station.Using prefixesThe amount of power involved can be very different depending on where it is used. Power stations produce a lot of power whereas in comparison a light bulb uses much smaller amounts of power. Prefixes are used to make the numbers involved in different contexts more convenient.1 kW = 1,000 W1 MW = 1,000 kW or 1,000,000 W 1 GW = 1,000 MW or 1,000,000,000 W1 TW = 1,000 GW or 1,000,000,000,000 WA light bulb may only use 60 W so no prefix is needed. But a 15,000 W cooker maybe better expressed as 15 kW. A train may have a power of 1,500,000 W but it would be easier to say 1.5 MW.

284,Energy conservation and dissipation,"Energy can be transferred usefully, stored or dissipated, but it cannot be created or destroyed.ConservationIn all cases, energy comes from one store and is transferred to another store. This means that all the energy in the Universe was present at the Big Bang and will still be around at the very end of time. DissipationWhen a child comes down a slide, she begins to pick up speed. Energy is shifting from a gravitational store into a kinetic store.However, not all of the energy is transferred into the kinetic store. As some work is done pushing against the rough surface of the slide, some of the energy is transferred to the slide and raises the temperature of the slide.No system is perfect. Whenever there is a change in a system, energy is transferred and some of that energy is dissipated.Dissipation is a term that is often used to describe ways in which energy is wasted. Any energy that is not transferred to useful energy stores is said to be wasted because it is lost to the surroundings. Electrical cables warming up are a good example of this. It is not useful to have hot wires behind a television as energy is dissipated to the surrounding air.In a mechanical system, energy is dissipated when two surfaces rub together. Work is done against friction which causes heating of the two surfaces - so the internal (thermal) energy of the surfaces increases. Adding lubricant between the surfaces reduces this friction and so less heat is wasted, like on a conveyor belt for example. In an electrical context new types of component can be more energy-efficient such as LED light bulbs as opposed to filament lamps, and using these cause less energy to be wasted.Examples of dissipationEnergy is usually lost by heating up the surroundings though sometimes energy is dissipated as sound waves.The ways in which energy is dissipated depends on the system:for a radio or set of speakers the electrical work is transferred into useful sound waves and infrared radiation is dissipated - ie wasted as heat energyfor a tumble dryer, the electrical work  is transferred into useful internal (thermal) energy which helps to dry clothes - energy is dissipated  by sound waves and by thermal energy of the surroundings which is not usefully used to dry the clothes",Energy resources,Energy changes,States of matter,Combined Science
285,Energy change calculations ,"Calculating kinetic energyThe amount of kinetic energy of a moving object can be calculated using the equation:Kinetic energy =  ½  _ mass _ (velocity)2Ek =  ½  m v2This is when:kinetic energy (Ek ) is measured in joules (J)mass (m) is measured in kilograms (kg)velocity (v) is measured in metres per second (m/s)ExampleAn apple of mass 100 g falls from a tree. It reaches a speed of 6 m/s before it lands on the ground.

The tower is 56 m high. Given that g = 10 N/kg, how much gravitational potential energy has the ball gained?Ep  = mghEp  = 5 _ 10 _ 56Ep  = 2,800 JQuestionHow much gravitational potential energy does a 500 g book gain when it is lifted up 1.5 m onto a shelf?Reveal answerupdownEp  = mghEp  = 0.5 _ 10 _ 1.5Ep  = 7.5 JFor any of these equations you may need to change the subject of the formula.Calculating energy transformed in an electrical applianceThe amount of energy transformed in an electrical appliance can be calculated using the equation:energy transformed = power _ timeE = PtThis is when:energy transformed in the appliance (E) is measured in joules (J)power (P) is the power of the appliance measured in watts (W)time (t) is the time the appliance is switched on for measured in seconds (s)QuestionHow much energy is transformed in a 2 kW kettle in two minutes?Reveal answerupdown2 kW = 2,000 W and two minutes = 120 secondsE = PtE = 2,000 _ 120E = 240,000 JCalculations involving the conservation of energyExampleScientists can use the conservation of energy to estimate future values. For example, when the 5 kg ball is dropped from the top of the tower, how fast was it travelling when it hit the ground?Assume the ball is streamlined so that air resistance is minimal. If this is the case, all the energy from the gravitational store goes into the kinetic store and it can be said that: mgh =  ½ mv2In the above example:mgh = 2,800 J½ mv2 = 2,800Changing the subject:v = \( \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 2,800}{\text{m}}}\)Since, m = 5v =\( \sqrt{\frac{5,600}{5}}\)v = 33.5 m/sExampleMost energy transfers result in energy being dissipated. An electric motor is being used to winch up a lift. The energy transformed in the motor should increase the gravitational potential energy store but because the motor becomes hot during use, the thermal energy store of the surroundings is also increased as energy is dissipated.The lift has a mass of 400 kg and is lifted up a vertical distance of 25 m. The power of the electric motor is 5,000 W and it takes the motor 25 s to move the lift. How much energy is dissipated to the surroundings?First find the increase of the gravitational potential energy store:Ep = mghEp = 400 _ 10 _ 25Ep = 100,000 JNext find the energy transformed in the electric motor:E = PtE = 5,000 _ 25E = 125,000 JThe energy transformed in the motor is more than the gravitational potential energy gained by the lift. The difference has been dissipated as heat to the surroundings. The difference is:125,000 - 100,000= 25,000 JSo, 25,000 J has been dissipated to the surroundings.",Energy resources,Energy changes,Forces,Energy changes
286,Preventing unwanted energy transfers,"Devices waste energy for various reasons including friction between their moving parts, electrical resistance, and unwanted sound energy.  In most cases, this waste energy is energy that has been shifted into the environment and raises the temperature of the surroundings. In order to make further use of this energy it has to be retrieved from each individual air particle. Clearly, this is very difficult, if not impossible. It is much better to prevent the energy being shifted, or dissipated, to the surroundings.It is impossible to completely prevent unwanted energy transfer, the best that can be done is to reduce them. Some of the most common ways to reduce these unwanted energy transfers are:LubricationFrictional forces cause surfaces to heat up resulting in an unwanted energy transfer. Reducing the friction between two surfaces can reduce this unwanted energy transfer.Friction is sometimes reduced by placing rollers or ball bearings between the surfaces but, most often, oil is used to lubricate the surfaces and allow them to slide smoothly over each other.Thermal insulationHeating a house, for example, can be a problem. A great deal of energy is wasted through the windows, doors and roof.There are some simple ways to reduce this loss, including fitting carpets, curtains and draught excluders.Energy loss through windows can be reduced using double glazing. These kind of windows have air or a vacuum between the two panes of glass. Air is a poor conductor, while a vacuum can only transfer energy by radiation.Energy loss through walls can be reduced using cavity wall insulation. This involves blowing insulating material into the gap between the brick and the inside wall, which reduces the loss by air circulating inside the cavity, therefore reducing loss by convection through the cavity. Overall the heat loss conducting through the bricks and cavity is reduced; it can be said that the thermal conductivity has been reduced. Sometimes walls do not have a cavity. Thicker walls transfer heat by conduction more slowly than thinner walls. Adding a material of low thermal conductivity to these solid walls on either the inside or the outside reduces the heat loss because the lower the thermal conductivity of a material, the slower heat passes through the material.Energy loss through the roof can be reduced by laying loft insulation. This works in a similar way to cavity wall insulation.",Energy resources,Energy changes,States of matter,Combined Science
287,Energy efficiency,"Devices are designed to waste as little energy as possible. This means that as much of the input energy as possible should be transferred into useful energy stores.How good a device is at transferring energy input to useful energy output is called efficiency.A very efficient device will waste very little of its input energy. A very inefficient device will waste most of its input energy.The efficiency of a device is the proportion of the energy supplied that is transferred in useful ways. The efficiency can be calculated as a decimal or a percentage, using the equations:\[\text{efficiency}   = \frac{\text{useful energy transferred}}{\text{total energy supplied}}\]\[\text{percentage efficiency} = \text{efficiency} \times 100\]\[\text{percentage efficiency} = \frac{\text{useful energy transferred}}{\text{total energy supplied}} \times 100\]This is when both useful energy transferred and total energy supplied is measured in joules (J).ExampleThe energy supplied to a light bulb is 200 J. A total of 28 J of this is usefully transferred. How efficient is the light bulb?\[\text{efficiency}   = \frac{\text{useful energy transferred}}{\text{total energy supplied}}\]\[\text{efficiency} = \frac{28}{200}\]\[\text{efficiency} = 0.14\]\[\text{percentage efficiency} = \text{efficiency} \times 100\]= 0.14 _ 100percentage efficiency = 14%The light bulb is not very efficient since most of the energy supplied is not transferred usefully. Most of the energy is dissipated as infrared radiation and only 14% is transferred usefully as light radiation.Increasing efficiency _ Higher Understanding how energy moves through a system allows scientists and engineers to modify the system to improve the efficiency.A normal filament light bulb works by heating a thin wire until it glows. However, most of the energy that goes into a light bulb is actually used to heat the room!Light emitting diodes emit light without getting hot, so it is much more efficient to use these to provide light as much less input energy is wasted.There are other, simpler, ways of improving the efficiency of devices. For example:putting the right amount of water into a kettle means that energy will not be wasted heating water that won't be usednot putting fridges and freezers next to cookers and ovens in the kitchen - the air that is being cooled by the fridge/freezer will not be too warmallow room around fridges/freezers for the air to circulate otherwise the device may overheatlower the temperature setting that the washing machine uses to wash clothes - to avoid energy being wasted in heating the water ",Energy resources,Energy changes,States of matter,"Energy, rates and reactions"
288,Planning,"Shini Somara and Simon Clark present the steps that should be taken when planning a science investigationWhen scientists start to investigate something they usually have a hypothesis that they are testing. This means they have an idea about what will happen when they explore something or take some readings, but they need the evidence to either confirm their thinking or suggest they need to think again. From this they can make a prediction. It is easy to get mixed up between hypotheses and predictions.  For example, a hypothesis might be made about the way that springs behave when they are loaded. From this a prediction can be made about what will happen to a spring when force is added. VariablesOften an experiment involves things that can change, known as variables. Variables need to be identified, so they can then either be changed or controlled. There are three kinds of variable:dependentindependentcontrolScientists often want to find out if changing one variable makes a difference to other variables. In many (though not all) investigations the variables are kept constant - the control variables, apart from one which is varied - the independent variable. The effects of the independent variable is then determined by monitoring the dependent variable. An example would be investigating whether increasing the temperature of the reactants might alter the rate of the reaction. As it is the temperature which is changing, that would be the independent variable. The changing temperature alters the rate of reaction, therefore the reaction rate is the dependent variable. When carrying out the experiment, care has to be taken that other variables that affect the rate of reaction, such as concentration of reactants, are kept constant. These are control variables. Values and readingsThe values are the measurements used for the independent variable. If, for example, one of the variables in an experiment was length, it would be important to decide the maximum and minimum values, and also the intervals between values. If enzyme activity at different pH values was being investigated, a decision would have to be made on what values of pH to use. This decision would take into account elements such as available equipment, time constraints, and safety. When measurements are being taken, it is usually appropriate to repeat them. Sometimes, there are lots of possible readings that could be taken. For example if the distribution of daisies on a playing field was being explored, it wouldn__ be necessary to count every one; however, it wouldn__ be a good idea to just look at the ones close to the fence. A sampling technique should be used to decide which ones to look at. It might, for example, involve the method of randomly placing quadrats. A mean is then calculated.

289,Manipulating equipment,"Shini and Simon demonstrate the key points to consider when using equipment in science experimentsAfter planning an investigation, the next step is to think about what equipment to use, and how to conduct the experiment safely.If certain chemicals are going to be used, the potential hazards need to be identified to ensure that they__e used safely. This might affect the concentrations of solutions or the quantities used and even whether those substances are used at all. The hazards also need to influence the general running of the experiment and how the equipment is used.The next step is to think about the most appropriate equipment to use.  For example, the volume of a liquid could be measured using a beaker, a measuring cylinder or a burette. In different circumstances one of these might be safer or more accurate than others, which would affect the choice.
 If you need to measure out 5 cm3 of liquid then a 10 cm3 measuring cylinder would give a more accurate volume then using a 100 cm3 measuring cylinder. Also, using balances that measure mass to the nearest 0.01 g will give a more accurate measurement then using ones that measure mass to the nearest gram.",Practical skills for carrying out a scientific investigation,States of matter,States of matter,Energy changes
290,Observation,"Shini and Simon discuss the things to consider when observing a science investigationThe experiment should be conducted in a clear and systematic way to ensure the data is complete and of a high quality. In an experiment into the relationship between force, mass and acceleration a toy car of different masses runs down a ramp. The acceleration needs to be measured several times at each mass. The repeats would all need to be done in the same way and with care to ensure precise data. If you observe that a repeat is not similar to the others then it is good idea to repeat it.It is also important to pay careful attention while the experiment is being carried out. It might be that the car starts to deviate from a straight line path; which if significant may mean that the method should be modified.Taking accurate measurements When using observations to collect data during an experiment it is important to be as accurate as possible. For example, a reaction commonly used to investigate rate is between sodium thiosulfate and hydrochloric acid. The reaction takes place in a conical flask standing on a piece of paper where a cross has been drawn. At first, it is easy to see the cross through the reaction mixture. However, during the reaction the solution becomes cloudy. The time taken for the cross to become completely obscured is used as a way of measuring the rate of reaction. Different people might make the call as to whether the cross has been completely obscured at slightly different points so it might be decided to use the same person to make all the observations.",Practical skills for carrying out a scientific investigation,States of matter,States of matter,Movement and interactions
291,Analysing,"Shini and Simon talk through the steps that should be taken when analysing a science investigationStudying the data Data collected during an investigation is normally displayed in a results table. At this point you can study your repeats to see how close they are. Repeats that are similar are said to be precise. Sometimes you may have an anomalous repeat. If this is the result of a measurement error it can be ignored, although it is good practice to repeat that measurement again.How to display the dataIt can be difficult to see the relationship between the variables from a results table so often the means are plotted on a graph or chart to analyse the results further. It is important to choose the most appropriate type of graph or chart.If both the independent and dependent variables are continuous data then a line graph (also called a scatter graph) is the best choice. Usually a line of best fit will be drawn to show the trend in the data. This will allow you to see the relationship between the variables, for example if they are proportional.Also, you can see if any of the values are anomalous as they will be placed far away from the line of best fit. An example of where a line graph would be used is in an investigation to see if temperature affects the rate of a reaction.A bar chart is used if the independent variable has different categories. For example, to display the frequency of different eye colours in a group of people.",Practical skills for carrying out a scientific investigation,Combined Science,Forces,Movement and interactions
292,Evaluating,"Shini and Simon present steps that should be taken when evaluating a science investigationThe final stage is to consider what has been learned from the investigation and the quality of the data. If it is decided that the experiment could have been improved in some way; suggestions should be considered of how and why. Drawing conclusionsIn this part you will say what your results show, and how this relates to the prediction you made at the start of the investigation.Evaluating dataYou need to consider if the data is of high quality. As well as looking at precision of the results, you can also consider repeatability and reproducibility.Results are said to be repeatable if similar results are obtained when you repeat your investigation. To check reproducibility, you need to get someone else to follow your method and see if their results are similar to yours.If the data is considered to not be of high quality then the method used might not be suitable.Suggesting improvementsHow accurate were your results? If there are sources of error then they will not be close to the true value and so not accurate. There are different sources of error:Random errors are due to things you have no control over, such as a change in room temperature whilst you were collecting the results. Repeating your measurements and finding a mean will reduce the effect of random errors.Systematic errors are due to problems with the equipment you used. For example, the balances you used may have been out by 0.1 g for every measurement. When discussing how to improve your investigation you may consider how to remove these sources of error and how to better use the equipment to make sure your readings are more accurate.You may also decide that to see a clearer pattern in the results you need to take more measurements and what values these will take.",Practical skills for carrying out a scientific investigation,Combined Science,Cells in animals and plants,Homeostasis
