# Keyword-based text classification method
This repository is part of the 2022 MA Text mining thesis "Mapping text to learning objectives: A keyword-based text classification method" by Jingyue Zhang. This thesis project was part of an internship offered by EDIA and was supervised by Hennie van der Vliet, Pia Sommerauer, Mark Breuker and Isa Maks.

# To Do
Once you start, please go through the following steps to tailor this template to your project

## Thesis report
You may decide to upload your report here directly, or to simply add a reference to where the report is hosted (e.g. Overleaf)
- [ ] Add a reference to the thesis report

## Data 
To ensure reproducibility, Yu need to provide the data your project uses.
- [ ] Add your data in the data folder

Sometimes, sharing sharing data is not straightforward. For example, there may be restrictions regarding with whom or how you can share the data you have. Some other times, the data you are using is open and easily accessible from other sites, in which case you might want to point directly to the original source. Either way, if this is the case for you please 
- [ ] Add the data folder to ``.gitignore`` in order to avoid commiting these files to Github. For this you can simply uncomment the last line in the ``.gitignore`` file  
```
# Tailored ignored files
data/*
```
- [ ] Make sure to add a ``README.md`` file inside the data folder, where you explain in detail how to obtain and structure the data

## README
- [ ] Add instructions on how to set up the project, how to run your code and what to expect as an output.
